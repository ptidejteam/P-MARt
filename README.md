# P-MARt
## Pattern-like Micro-Architecture Repository

P-MARt is an initiative to foster empirical research on design patterns. P-MARt is a **repository** of micro-architectures similar to design motifs. A **design motif** represents the solution of a design pattern. The **micro-architectures** are from many different programs, which sources are available. The repository is an XML document containing **peer-reviewed** micro-architectures including complete and approximate forms. P-MARt also includes an API and its implementation to allow the automated metric computation and summarise stored programs, design patterns, and micro-architectures using a Visitor to traverse the repository easily.

P-MARt and its associated tools are freely available under the [LPGL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html) license. Please contribute by [sharing](mailto:p-mart@ptidej.net) your micro-architectures.

P-MARt was/is used in several projects, for example, to build quality models, see related papers on [code and design smells](https://www.ptidej.net/publications/Keyword/TOPIC-BCODE-AND-DESIGN-SMELLSB.php) as well as [quality models](https://www.ptidej.net/publications/Keyword/TOPIC-BQUALITY-MODELSB.php).
