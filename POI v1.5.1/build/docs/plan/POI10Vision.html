<h2>Preface</h2>
<div class="section"> 
        
<p> 
		(21-Jan-02) While this document is just full of useful project 
		introductory information and I do suggest those interested in getting
		involved in the project read it, it is woefully out of date.
	</p>
	
<p>
		We deliberately allowed this document to run out of date because it 
		is a good reflection of what the original vision was for POI 1.0.
		You'll note that some of the terminology is not used in quite the same 
		way any longer.  I've made some minor corrections where reading this
		confused me.  An example: in some places this document may refer to
		POI API instead of POIFS API.  When this vision was written we had 
		an incomplete understanding of the project.  
	</p>
	
<p>
		Lastly, the scope of the project expanded dramatically near the end 
		of the 1.0 cycle.  Our vision at the time was to focus merely on the
		Excel port (having no idea how the project would grow or be received)
		and provide the OLE 2 Compound Document port for others to port later
		formats.  We now plan to spearhead these ports under the umbrella of 
		the POI project.  So, you've been warned.  Read on, but just realize
		that we had a fuzzy view of things to come, and hindsight is 20-20.
	</p>
	
<p>
		If I recall major holes were: a complete understanding of the format 
		of OLE 2 Compound Document format, Excel file format, and exactly how
		Cocoon 2 Serializers worked.  (that just about covers the whole range
		huh?)
	</p>
 
</div>

 
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="section">
  
<h3>1.1 Purpose of this document</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The purpose of this document is to
		collect, analyze and define high-level requirements, user needs and
		features of the HSSF Serializer for Cocoon 2 and related libraries.
		The HSSF Serializer is a java class supporting the Serializer
		interface from the Cocoon 2 project and outputting in a compatible
		format of that used by the spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel '97.
		The HSSF Serializer will be responsible for converting XML
		spreadsheet-like documents into Excel-compatible XLS spreadsheets.
	</p>
  
</div>
  

  
<h3>1.2 Project Overview</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		Many web apps today hit a brick wall
		when it comes to the user request that they be able to easily
		manipulate their reports and data extracts in the popular Microsoft
		Excel spreadsheet format. This often causes inferior technologies to be
		chosen for the project simply because they easily support this
		format. This project seeks to extend existing XML, Java and Apache
		Cocoon 2 project technologies by: 	  
	</p>
	
		
<blockquote>
<ul>
			
<li>
				providing an extensible library
				(POIFS) which reads/writes in a compatable format to OLE 2 Compound
				Document Format (aka Structured Storage Format) for easy
			  	implementation of other document types;
			</li>
			
<li>
				providing a library (HSSF) for
				manipulating spreadsheet data and outputting it in a compatible
				format to Microsoft Excel XLS format;
			</li>
			
<li>
				and providing a Cocoon 2
				Serializer (HSSFSerializer) for serializing XML documents as
				Excel-compatible spreadsheets.
			</li>
		
</ul>
</blockquote>
	
  
</div>
 
</div>
 
<h2>2. User Description</h2>
<div class="section">
   
<h3>2.1 User/Market Demographics</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		There are a number of enthusiastic
		users of XML, UNIX and Java technology. Secondly, the Microsoft
		solution for outputting Office Document formats often involves
		actually manipulating the software as an OLE Server. This method
		provides extremely low performance, extremely high overhead and is
		only capable of handling one document at a time.
	</p>
	
<blockquote>
<ol>
		
<li>
		Our intended audience for the HSSF
		Serializer portion of this project are developers writing reports or
		data extracts in XML format. 
		</li>
		
<li>
		Our intended audience for the HSSF
		library portion of this project is ourselves as we are developing
		the Serializer and anyone who needs to write to Excel spreadsheets
		in a non-XML Java environment or who has specific needs not
		addressed by the Serializer.
		</li>
		
<li>
		Our intended audience for the
		"POIFS" OLE 2 Compound Document format reader/writer is
		ourselves as we are writing the HSSF library and secondly, anyone
		wishing to provide other libraries for reading/writing OLE 2
		Compound Document Format in Java.
		</li>
	
</ol>
</blockquote>
   
</div>
   
<h3>2.2. User environment</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The users of this software shall be
		developers in a Java environment on any Operating System or power
		users who are capable of XML document generation/deployment.		
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>2.3. Key User Needs</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The OLE 2 Compound Document format is
		undocumented for all practical purposes and cryptic for all
		impractical purposes. Developer needs in this area include
		documentation and an easy to use library for reading and writing in
		this format without requiring the developer to have intimate
		knowledge of the format. 		
	</p>
	
<p>
		There is currently no good way to write
		to Microsoft Excel documents from Java or from a non-Microsoft
		Windows based platform for that matter. Developers need an easy to
		use library that supports a reasonable feature set and allows
		seperation of data from formatting/stylistic concerns.
	</p>
	
<p>
		There is currently no good way to
		transform XML data to Microsoft Excel. Apache's Cocoon 2 project
		supplies a complete framework for XML, but nothing for outputting in
		Excel's XLS format. Developers and power users alike need a simple
		method to output XML documents to Excel through server-side
		processing.
	</p>
	

   
</div>
   
<h3>2.4. Alternatives and Competition</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
        Originally there weren't any decent <a href="../hssf/alternatives.html">alternatives</a> for reading or writing
        to Excel.  This has changed somewhat.
	</p>
   
</div>
 
</div>
 
<h2>3. Project Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
   
<h3>3.1. Project Perspective</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The produced code shall be licensed by
		the Apache License as used by the Cocoon 2 project and maintained on
		a project page until such time as the Cocoon 2 developers accept it
		as a donation (at which time the copyright will be turned over to
		them).	
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>3.2. Project Position Statement</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		For developers on a Java and/or XML
		environment this project will provide all the tools necessary for
		outputting XML data in the Microsoft Excel format. This project seeks
		to make the use of Microsoft Windows based servers unnecessary for
		file format considerations and to fully document the OLE 2 Compound
		Document format. The project aims not only to provide the tools for
		serializing XML to Excel's file format and the tools for writing to
		that file format from Java, but also to provide the tools for later
		projects to convert other OLE 2 Compound Document formats to pure
		Java APIs.

<h2>5. Other Product Requirements</h2>

<h3>5.1. Applicable Standards</h3>
<div class="section">

<h3>5.3. Performance Requirements</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		All components must perform well enough
		to be practical for use in a webserver environment (especially
		Cocoon2/Tomcat/Apache combo)
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>5.4. Environmental Requirements</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The software will run primarily in
		developer environments. We should make some allowances for
		not-highly-technical users to write XML documents for the HSSF
		Serializer. All other components will assume intermediate Java 2
		knowledge. No XML knowledge will be required except for using the
		HSSF Serializer. As much documentation as is practical shall be
		required for all components as XML is relatively new, and the
		concepts introduced for writing spreadsheets and to POI filesystems
		will be brand new to Java and many Java developers.
