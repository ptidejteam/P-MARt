<h2>Preface</h2>
<div class="section">
        
<p>
                This is the POI 2.0 cycle vision document.  Although the vision
                has not changed and this document is certainly not out of date and 
                the vision has not changed, the structure of the project has
                changed a bit.  We're not going to change the vision document to
                reflect this (however proper that may be) because it would only
                involve deletion.  There is no purpose in providing less
                information provided we give clarification.
        </p>
        
<p>
                This document was created before the POI components for 
                <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon">Apache Cocoon</a> 
                were accepted into the Cocoon project itself.  It was also
                written before POI was accepted into Jakarta.  So while the
                vision hasn't changed some of the components are actually now
                part of other projects.  We'll still be working on them on the
                same timeline roughly (minus the overhead of coordination with
                other groups), but they are no longer technically part of the
                POI project itself.

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="section">
  
<h3>1.1 Purpose of this document</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
                The purpose of this document is to
                collect, analyze and define high-level requirements, user needs, 
                and features of the second release of the POI project software. 
                The POI project currently consists of the following components: 
                the HSSF Serializer, the HSSF library and the POIFS library.
	</p>
        
<blockquote>
<ul>
	        
<li>
                        The HSSF Serializer is a set of Java classes whose main 
                        class supports the Serializer interface from the Cocoon 
                        2 project and outputs the serialized data in a format 
                        compatible with the spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel 
                        '97.
                </li>
	        
<li>
                        The HSSF library is a set of classes for reading and 
                        writing Microsoft Excel 97 file format using pure Java.
                </li>
	        
<li>
                        The POIFS library is a set of classes for reading and 
                        writing Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format using 
                        pure Java.
                </li>
        
</ul>
</blockquote>  
        
<p>By the completion of this release cycle the POI project will also
        include the HSSF Generator and the HDF library.
        </p>
        
<blockquote>
<ul>
	        
<li>The HSSF Generator will be responsible for using HSSF to read
	        in the XLS (Excel 97) file format and create SAX events. The HSSF
	        Generator will support the applicable interfaces specified by the
	        Apache Cocoon 2 project.
                </li>
	        
<li>The HDF library will provide a set of high level interfaces
	        for reading and writing Microsoft Word 97 file format using pure
	        Java.</li>
        
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Project Overview</h3>
<div class="section">
        
<p>
                The first release of the POI project
                was an astounding success. This release seeks to build on that
                success by:
        </p>
        
<blockquote>
<ul>
                
<li>
                        Refactoring POIFS into imput and
                        output classes as well as an event-driven API for reading.
                </li>
                
<li>
                        Refactor HSSF for greater
	                performance as well as an event-driven API for reading
                </li>
                
<li>
                        Extend HSSF by adding the ability to read and write formulas.
                </li>
	        
<li>
                        Extend HSSF by adding the ability to read and write 
                        user-defined styles.
                </li>
	        
<li>
                        Create a Cocoon 2 Generator for HSSF using the same tags 
                        as the HSSF Serializer.
                </li>
	        
<li>
                        Create a new library (HDF) for reading and writing 
                        Microsoft Word DOC format.
                </li>
	        
<li>
                        Refactor the HSSFSerializer into a separate extensible 
                        POIFSSerializer and HSSFSerializer
                </li>
                
<li>
                        Providing the create excel charts. (write only)
                </li>
        
</ul>

<h2>2. User Description</h2>
<div class="section">
   
<h3>2.1 User/Market Demographics</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
                There are a number of enthusiastic
                users of XML, UNIX and Java technology. Furthermore, the Microsoft
                solution for outputting Office Document formats often involves
                actually manipulating the software as an OLE Server. This method
                provides extremely low performance, extremely high overhead and is
                only capable of handing one document at a time.	
        </p>

                        Our intended audience for the HSSF
                        Serializer portion of this project are developers writing reports or
                        data extracts in XML format.

                        Our intended audience for the HSSF
                        library portion of this project is ourselves as we are developing
                        the HSSF serializer and anyone who needs to read and write Excel
                        spreadsheets in a non-XML Java environment, or who has specific
                        needs not addressed by the Serializer

                        libraries and anyone wishing to provide other libraries for
                        reading/writing other file formats utilizing the OLE 2 Compound
                        Document Format in Java.

<h3>2.2. User environment</h3>
<div class="section">
        
<p>
                The users of this software shall be
                developers in a Java environment on any operating system, or power
                users who are capable of XML document generation/deployment.
        </p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>2.3. Key User Needs</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
                The HSSF library currently requires a
                full object representation to be created before reading values. This
                results in very high memory utilization. We need to reduce this
                substantially for reading. It would be preferable to do this for
                writing, but it may not be possible due to the constraints imposed by
                the file format itself. Memory utilization during read is our top
                user complaint.	
        </p>
	
<p>
                The POIFS library currently requires a
                full object representation to be created before reading values. This
                results in very high memory utilization. We need to reduce this
                substantially for reading.	
        </p>
        
<p>
                The HSSF library currently ignores
                formula cells and identifies them as "UnknownRecord" at the
                lower level of the API. We must provide a way to read and write
                formulas. This is now the top requested feature.
        </p>
        
<p>
                The HSSF library currently does not support
                charts.  This is a key requirement of some users who wish to use HSSF
                in a reporting engine.
        </p>
        
<p>
                The HSSF Serializer currently does not
                provide serialization for cell styling. User's will want stylish
                spreadsheets to result from their XML.
        </p>
        
<p>
                There is currently no way to generate
                the XML from an XLS that is consistent with the format used by the
                HSSF Serializer.
        </p>
        
<p>
                There should be a way to read and write
                the DOC file format using pure Java.
        </p>

<h3>2.4. Alternatives and Competition</h3>
<div class="section">        
	        
<p>
            Originally there weren't any decent <a href="../hssf/alternatives.html">alternatives</a> for reading or writing
            to Excel.  This has changed somewhat.

<h3>3.1. Project Perspective</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
                The produced code shall be licensed by
                the Apache License as used by the Cocoon 2 project (APL 1.1) and
                maintained on at <a href="http://poi.sourceforge.net/">http://poi.sourceforge.net</a>
                and <a href="http://sourcefoge.net/projects/poi">http://sourcefoge.net/projects/poi</a>.
                It is our hope to at some point integrate with the various Apache
                projects (xml.apache.org and jakarta.apache.org), at which point we'd
                turn the copyright over to them.

</div>
   
<h3>3.2. Project Position Statement</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
                For developers on a Java and/or XML
                environment this project will provide all the tools necessary for
                outputting XML data in the Microsoft Excel format. This project seeks
                to make the use of Microsoft Windows based servers unnecessary for
                file format considerations and to fully document the OLE 2 Compound
                Document format. The project aims not only to provide the tools for
                serializing XML to Excel and Word file formats and the tools for
                writing to those file formats from Java, but also to provide the
                tools for later projects to convert other OLE 2 Compound Document
                formats to pure Java APIs.

<h2>5. Other Product Requirements</h2>
<div class="section">
   
<h3>5.1. Applicable Standards</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		All Java code will be 100% pure Java.
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>5.2. System Requirements</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The minimum system requirements for the POIFS API are:
	</p>
	
<blockquote>
<ul>
		
<li>64 Mbytes memory</li>
		
<li>Java 2 environment</li>
		
<li>Pentium or better processor (or equivalent on other platforms)</li>

<li>HSSF API</li>
		
<li>POI API</li>
	
</ul>
</blockquote>	
   
</div>
   
<h3>5.3. Performance Requirements</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		All components must perform well enough
		to be practical for use in a webserver environment (especially
		the "killer trio": Cocoon2/Tomcat/Apache combo)
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>5.4. Environmental Requirements</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The software will run primarily in
		developer environments. We should make some allowances for
		not-highly-technical users to write XML documents for the HSSF
		Serializer. All other components will assume intermediate Java 2
		knowledge. No XML knowledge will be required except for using the
		HSSF Serializer. As much documentation as is practical shall be
		required for all components as XML is relatively new, and the
		concepts introduced for writing spreadsheets and to POI filesystems
		will be brand new to Java and many Java developers.
	</p>
   
</div>
 
</div>
 
<h2>6. Documentation Requirements</h2>
<div class="section">
   
<h3>6.1 POI Filesystem</h3>

		The filesystem as read and written by
		POI shall be fully documented and explained so that the average Java
		developer can understand it.
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>6.2. POI API</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The POI API will be fully documented
		through Javadoc. A walkthrough of using the high level POI API shall

		provided for the low-level POI APIs.	
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>6.3. HSSF File Format</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The HSSF File Format as implemented by
		the HSSF API will be fully documented. No documentation will be
		provided for features that are not supported by HSSF API that are
		supported by the Excel 97 File Format. Care will be taken not to
		infringe on any "legal stuff".  Additionally, we are 
                collaborating with the fine folks at OpenOffice.org on
                *free* documentation of the format.
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>6.4. HSSF API</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The HSSF API will be documented by
		javadoc. A walkthrough of using the high level HSSF API shall be
		provided. No documentation outside of the Javadoc shall be provided
		for the low level HSSF APIs.	
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>6.5 HDF API</h3>

<p>
                The HDF API will be documented by
                javadoc. A walkthrough of using the high level HDF API shall be
                provided. No documentation outside of the Javadoc shall be provided
                for the low level HDF APIs.        
	</p>
   
</div>   
   
<h3>6.6 HSSF Serializer</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The HSSF Serializer will be documented
		by javadoc. 	
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>6.7 HSSF Generator</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The HSSF Generator will be documented
		by javadoc. 	
	</p>
   
</div>      
   
<h3>6.8 HSSF Serializer Tag language</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		The XML tag language along with
		function and usage shall be fully documented. Examples will be
		provided as well.
	</p>

</div>
 
<h2>7. Terminology</h2>
<div class="section">
   
<h3>7.1 Filesystem</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		filesystem shall refer only to the POI formatted archive.
	</p>
   
</div>
   
<h3>7.2 File</h3>
<div class="section">
	
<p>
		file shall refer to the embedded data stream within a 
		POI filesystem. This will be the actual embedded document.
