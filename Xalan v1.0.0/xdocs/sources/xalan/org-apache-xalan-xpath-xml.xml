<s1 title="org.apache.xalan.xpath.xml package">
  <s2 title="Summary">
     <p>Infrastructure for working with an XML parser.</p>
   </s2>     
     <s2 title="Description">
      <p>An implementation of the {@link org.apache.xalan.xpath.xml.XMLParserLiaison} interface provides a liaison
     between the XSLT processor and an XML parser. Unless you specify an XML parser and your own implementation of 
     the XMLParserLiaison interface, &xslt4j; uses one of the following extensions of the 
     {@link org.apache.xalan.xpath.xml.XMLParserLiaisonDefault}:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>{@link org.apache.xalan.xpath.dtm.DTMLiaison org.apache.xalan.xpath.dtm.DTMLiaison} for the DTM XML Parser</li>
     <li>{@link org.apache.xalan.xpath.xdom.XercesLiaison org.apache.xalan.xpath.xdom.XercesLiaison} for the Xerces XML
      Parser</li>
     </ul>  
     <p>This package also includes four implementations of the <resource-ref idref="SAX"/> <resource-ref
      idref="SAXDocumentHandler"/> interface:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>{@link org.apache.xalan.xpath.xml.FormatterToDOM}</li>
     <li>{@link org.apache.xalan.xpath.xml.FormatterToXML}</li>
     <li>{@link org.apache.xalan.xpath.xml.FormatterToHTML} (an extension of FormatterToXML)</li>
     <li>{@link org.apache.xalan.xpath.xml.FormatterToText}</li>
     </ul>
