<s1 title="&xslt4j; DTM">
      
	 <s2 title="Using the &xslt4j; Document Table Model (DTM)">
     <p>The Document Object Model (<resource-ref idref="DOM"/>) provides a standard interface for interacting
     with XML documents. &xslt4j; supports this interface. For large XML documents, however, this may involve considerable
     overhead, since &xslt4j; must create one or more Java objects for each Node in the document DOM tree.</p>
     <p>For the majority of cases -- your input and output are URLs, files, or streams, and you use the default Liaison
     (<resource-ref idref="DTMLiaisonDoc"/>) and XML parser, &xslt4j; avoids this overhead by implementing the Document Table
     Model (DTM), a "pseudo-DOM" that uses integer arrays in place of the DOM. For larger input and output trees, the
      performance improvements can be very significant.</p>
     <p>The <resource-ref idref="XSLTProcessorFactoryGetProcessorDoc"/> sets up an XSLT processor to use the default DTM liaison
      and XML parser. If your input or output turns out to be a DOM Node, the XSLTProcessor automatically switches to the
      <resource-ref idref="XercesLiaisonDoc"/> and the Xerces DOM parser. You can explicitly instantiate an XSLTProcessor to use
      XercesLiaison and the Xerces DOM parser as follows:</p>
      <p><code>org.apache.xalan.xslt.XSLTProcessor xsltProc = org.apache.xalan.xslt.XSLTProcessorFactory.getProcessor(</code><br/>
      <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new org.apache.xalan.xpath.xdom.XercesLiaison());</code></p>
      <p>For more information, see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="dom-in">Processing DOM input and Producing DOM
      output</link>.</p>
      <note>The DTM parser always attempts to expand eentityreferences in the source tree and stylesheet
      tree. If you attempt to turn off entity reference expansion -- with DTMLiaison
      setShouldExpandEntitityRefs(false) -- DDTMLiaisondoes not make the setting and issues a message to that
      effect. If you want to turn off entity rreferenceexpansion, instantiate the XSLTProcessor to use XercesLiaison and the
      Xerces DOM parser.</note>
