/**
 * <p>
 * This class is responsible for instantiating the correct LoggingSystem
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The approach is :
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> 
 *      First try to see if the user is passing in a living object
 *      that is a LogSystem, allowing the app to give is living
 *      custom loggers.
 *  </li>
 *  <li> 
 *       Next, run through the (possible) list of classes specified
 *       specified as loggers, taking the first one that appears to 
 *       work.  This is how we support finding either log4j or
 *       logkit, whichever is in the classpath, as both are 
 *       listed as defaults.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      Finally, we turn to 'faith-based' logging, and hope that
 *      logkit is in the classpath, and try for an AvalonLogSystem
 *      as a final gasp.  After that, there is nothing we can do.
 *  </li>
