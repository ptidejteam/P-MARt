MapperXML
To Do Items

MapperXML Ideas Under Consideration
===============================================================
o   Add master context to ServletApp which it will pass on to ServletForms.
o   Consider creation of an option list descriptor for use by ComponentFactory
    to use for binding HTMLSelect components.
o	New ComponentFactory which will read an XML component manifest
	for list of components and properties.
o   Modify ServletFormFactory for cache control of forms (min, max)
o	Modify ServletFormFactory and add management control to allow
	flushing/modification at runtime.
o   Research if the classloader can be set in the init method of
    ServletApp. Research other alternatives.
o	XMLComponents which can generate client-side Javascript and can
	be sensitive to browser types and user preferences.

MapperXML Modifications
===============================================================
o	Cleanup imports
o   Deprecate get/setList and replace with get/setListValueHolder in
    SelectModel, DefaultSelectModel, SelectField & HTMLSelect
o	Add Log4J & Java 1.4 LoggerAdapters. default: Log4J, Java, SimpleLogger
o   Increase diagnostic info for NotInListException
o   Component factory needs support for more html items like <p>,<b>,etc
o   Refactor Dispatcher's to use base class methods
o   Review/refactor renderers to use properties set in AbstractRenderer
o   All TextFields: if data conversion error occurs, (in DataTypes),
    need better Exception (maybe ModelParseException?)
o   Harden code to eliminate/reduce null pointer exceptions when
    developer does not set all properties or invoke initialize
    methods properly. Use Debug.WARN messages instead with
    specific cause/recommendations.
o   Add behavior to remaining components for recycle - clear/reset
    values.
o	Consider adding property 'renderAlways' so that a control can be 
	set to only render a part of a document once (drop-down, 
	sale-items, etc).
o   Modify HTMLCheckbox. Add boolean property - only process input
    during POST.
o   Modify HTMLComponentFactory to preset selectedValue and
    unselectedValue properties from HTML document for HTMLCheckbox

MapperXML New Features
===============================================================
o   Create Unit Test for self-test of ServletForms. Develop unit testing
    methodology and write how-to.
    
    Self test goals:
    	verify id's
    	document valid

MapperGUI Ideas Under Consideration
===============================================================
o	Add components for SWT

MapperGUI Modifications
===============================================================
o	Cleanup imports
o   MTextField: add get/setValue() method
o	Refactor MTable and MTableColumn for less order specific
	property setting
o   Add undo and/or cancel to MapperGUI components

MapperGUI New Features
===============================================================
o   New MCheckBox component

Example Items
===============================================================
o   Example for Default actions with Triggers and Buttons

Documentation Items
===============================================================
o   Complete Developer's Guide for MapperXML
o   Complete JavaDoc for SelectField/Model changes
o	Project structure and development strategy and roles.

Fixes TODO
================================================================
o   Fix problem in component factory - when it is called more than once
    with SubFormNewsPage, it wipes out functionality - probably
    multiple components for same section? Normally, it should only
    be called once, but it should not cause problems if called
    more than once.
o   Problem in HTMLComponentFactory - problem when nesting multiple
    level templates (ie parent-child-grandchild)
