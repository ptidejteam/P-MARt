      <p>
       Velocity has a number of external jar dependencies. However, not all of these
       are needed every time.This document should help you do decide which jars must
       also be present if you want to integrate Velocity into your application.

      <p>
        The most common case is the integration of the Velocity runtime into your
        application. In this case, you must also add commons-collections, commons-lang
        and oro to your application (and either avalon-logkit or log4j for logging if
        required). If you already have one or more of these libraries in your application,
        you should check if you need to update their versions.
