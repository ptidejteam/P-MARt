   A <i>selection</i> is a a block of text marked for further
   manipulation. jEdit supports both
   range and rectangular selections, and several chunks of text can be
   selected simultaneously.
  </p><p>
   Dragging the mouse creates a range selection from where the mouse was
   pressed to where it was released.
   Holding down <b>Shift</b> while clicking a location in the
   buffer will create a selection from the caret position to the clicked
   location.
  </p><p>
   Holding down <b>Shift</b> in addition to a caret movement key
   (<b>Left</b>, <b>Up</b>, <b>Home</b>, etc) will
   extend a selection in the specified direction.
  </p><p>
   <b>Edit</b>&gt;<b>Select All</b> (shortcut:
   <b>Control</b>-<b>A</b>) selects the
   entire buffer.
  </p><p>
   <b>Edit</b>&gt;<b>Select
   None</b>&gt;<b>Select None</b> (shortcut:
   <b>Escape</b>) deactivates the selection.
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="rect-select"></a>Rectangular Selection</h3></div></div><p>
    Dragging with the <b>Control</b> key held down will create a
    rectangular selection. Holding down
    <b>Shift</b> and <b>Control</b> while clicking a
    location in the buffer will create a rectangular selection from the caret
    position to the clicked location.
   </p><p>
    It is possible to select a rectangle with zero width but non-zero height.
    This can be used to insert a new column between two existing
    columns, for example. Such zero-width selections are shown as a thin
    vertical line.
   </p><p>
    Rectangles can be deleted, copied, pasted, and operated on using ordinary
    editing commands.
   </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
     Rectangular selections are implemented using character offsets,
     not absolute screen positions, so they might not behave as you might
     expect if a proportional-width font is being used or if soft wrap is
     enabled. The text area font can be changed in the
     <b>Text Area</b> pane of the
     <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b>
     dialog box. For information about soft wrap,
     see <a href="word-wrap.html" title="Wrapping Long Lines">the section called &#8220;Wrapping Long Lines&#8221;</a>.
    </p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="multi-select"></a>Multiple Selection</h3></div></div><p>
    <b>Edit</b>&gt;<b>More
    Selection</b>&gt;<b>Multiple Selection</b>
    (keyboard shortcut: <b>Control</b>-<b>\</b>)
    turns multiple selection mode on and
    off. In multiple selection mode, multiple fragments of text can be selected
    and operated on simultaneously, and the caret can be moved independently
    of the selection. The status bar indicates if multiple
    selection mode is active; see <a href="views.html#status-bar" title="The Status Bar">the section called &#8220;The Status Bar&#8221;</a>.
   </p><p>
    Various jEdit commands behave differently with multiple selections:
   </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Commands that copy text place the contents of
    each selection, separated by line breaks, in the specified register.
    </p></li><li><p>Commands that insert (or paste) text replace each selection
    with the entire text that is being inserted.</p></li><li><p>Commands that filter text (such as <b>Spaces to
    Tabs</b>, <b>Range Comment</b>,
    <b>Replace in Selection</b>, and so on) behave as if
    each block was selected independently, and the command invoked on each in
    turn.</p></li><li><p>Line-based commands (such as <b>Shift Indent
    Left</b>, <b>Shift Indent Right</b>, and
    <b>Line Comment</b>) operate on each line that contains
    at least one selection.
    </p></li><li><p>Caret movement commands that would normally deactivate the
    selection (such as the arrow keys, while <b>Shift</b> is not being
    held down), move the caret, leaving the selection as-is.</p></li><li><p>Some older plugins may not support multiple selection at
    all.</p></li></ul></div><p>
    <b>Edit</b>&gt;<b>More
    Selection</b>&gt;<b>Select None</b>
    (shortcut: <b>Escape</b>) deactivates the selection containing the
    caret, if there is one. Otherwise it deactivates all active selections.
   </p><p>
    <b>Edit</b>&gt;<b>More
    Selection</b>&gt;<b>Invert Selection</b>
    (shortcut: <b>Control</b>-<b>E</b>
    <b>I</b>) selects a set of text chunks such that all text
    that was formerly part of a selection is now unselected, and all text that
    wasn't, is selected.
   </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
     Deactivating multiple selection
     mode while multiple blocks of text are selected will leave the selections
     in place, but you will not be able to add new selections until
     multiple selection mode is reactivated.
