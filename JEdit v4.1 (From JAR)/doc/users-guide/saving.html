   Changed made in a buffer do not affect the file on disk until the
   buffer is <i>saved</i>.
  </p><p>
   <b>File</b>&gt;<b>Save</b> (shortcut:
   <b>Control</b>-<b>S</b>)
   saves the current buffer to disk.
  </p><p>
   <b>File</b>&gt;<b>Save As</b> renames
   the buffer and saves it in a new location. Note that
   using this command to save over another open buffer will close the other
   buffer, to stop two buffers from being able to share the same path name.
  </p><p>
   <b>File</b>&gt;<b>Save a Copy As</b> saves
   the buffer to different location but does not rename it., but doesn't rename the
   buffer, and doesn't clear the &#8220;modified&#8221; flag. Note that
   using this command to save over another open buffer will automatically reload
   the other buffer.
  </p><p>
   <b>File</b>&gt;<b>Save All</b>
   (shortcut: <b>Control</b>-<b>E</b>
   <b>Control</b>-<b>S</b>) saves all
   open buffers to disk, asking for confirmation first.
  </p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Two-stage save</b></p><p>
    To prevent data loss in the unlikely case that jEdit should crash in the
    middle of saving a file, files are first saved to a temporary file named
    <tt>#<i><tt>filename</tt></i>#save#</tt>. If this
    operation is successful, the original file is replaced with the temporary
    file.
   </p><p>
    However, in some situations, this behavior is undesirable. For example,
    on Unix saving files this way will result in the owner and group of the
    file being reset. If this bothers you, you can disable this so-called
    &#8220;two-stage save&#8221; in the <b>Loading and Saving</b>
    pane of the
    <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b>
    dialog box.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2878850"></a>Autosave and Crash Recovery</h3></div></div><p>
    The autosave feature protects your work from computer crashes and
    such. Every 30 seconds, all buffers with unsaved changes are
    written out to their respective file names, enclosed in hash
    (&#8220;#&#8221;) characters. For example, <tt>program.c</tt>
    will be autosaved to <tt>#program.c#</tt>.
   </p><p>
    Saving a buffer using
    one of the commands in the previous section automatically deletes the
    autosave file, so they will only ever be visible in the unlikely
    event of a jEdit (or operating system) crash.
   </p><p>
    If an autosave file is
    found while a buffer is being loaded, jEdit will offer to recover the
    autosaved data.
   </p><p>
    The autosave interval can be changed
    in the <b>Loading and Saving</b> pane of the
    <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b>
    dialog box; see <a href="global-opts.html" title="The Global Options Dialog Box">the section called &#8220;The Global Options Dialog Box&#8221;</a>.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2878929"></a>Backups</h3></div></div><p>
    The backup feature can be used to roll back to the previous version
    of a file after changes were made. When a buffer is saved
    for the first time after being opened, its original contents are
    &#8220;backed up&#8221; under a different file name.
   </p><p>
    The behavior of the backup feature is specified in the<b>Loading and
    Saving</b> pane of the
    <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b>
    dialog box.
   </p><p>
    The default behavior is to back up the original contents
    to the buffer's file name suffixed with a tilde (&#8220;~&#8221;).
    For example, a file named <tt>paper.tex</tt> is backed up to
    <tt>paper.tex~</tt>.
   </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
     The <b>Max number of backups</b> setting determines the
     number of backups to save. Setting this to zero disables the backup
     feature. Settings this to more than one adds numbered suffixes to file
     names. By default only one backup is saved.
    </p></li><li><p>
     If the <b>Backup directory</b> setting is non-empty, backups
     are saved in that location. Otherwise, they are saved in the same directory
     as the original file. The latter is the default behavior.
    </p></li><li><p>
     The <b>Backup filename prefix</b> setting is the prefix that
     is added to the backed-up file name. This is empty by default.
    </p></li><li><p>
     The <b>Backup filename suffix</b> setting is the suffix that
     is added to the backed-up file name. This is &#8220;~&#8221; by default.
    </p></li><li><p>
     Backups can optionally be saved in a specified backup directory, instead of
     the directory of the original file. This can reduce clutter.
    </p></li><li><p>
     The <b>Backup on every save</b> option is off by default,
     which results in a backup only being created the first time a buffer is
     saved in an editing session. If switched on, backups are
     created every time a buffer is saved.
