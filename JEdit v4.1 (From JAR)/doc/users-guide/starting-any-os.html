   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system;
   on Unix systems, usually you would
   run the &#8220;jedit&#8221; command at the command line,
   or select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you might
   use the jEditLauncher package, which is documented in
   <a href="starting-windows.html" title="Starting jEdit on Windows">the section called &#8220;Starting jEdit on Windows&#8221;</a>.
  </p><p>
   If jEdit is started while another copy is already running, control is
   transferred to the running copy, and a second instance is not loaded.
   This saves time and memory if jEdit is started multiple times.
   Communication between instances of jEdit is implemented using
   TCP/IP sockets; the initial instance is known as the
   <i>server</i>, and subsequent invocations are
   <i>clients</i>.
  </p><p>
   If the <b><tt>-background</tt></b> command line switch is specified,
   jEdit will continue running and waiting for client requests even
   after all editor windows are closed. When run in background mode,
   you can open and close jEdit any number of times, only having
   to wait for it to start the first time. The downside of this
   is that jEdit will continue to consume memory when no windows
   are open.
  </p><p>
   For more information about command line switches that control the
   server feature, see <a href="cli-usage.html" title="Command Line Usage">the section called &#8220;Command Line Usage&#8221;</a>.
   Note that if you are using jEditLauncher
   to start jEdit on Windows, this switch cannot be specified on the
   MS-DOS prompt command line when starting jEdit; it must be set as described
   in <a href="launcher-starting.html" title="Starting jEdit">the section called &#8220;Starting jEdit&#8221;</a>.
  </p><p>
   Unlike other applications, jEdit automatically loads any files that were
   open last time in was used, so you can get back to work immediately, without
   having to find the files you are working on first. This feature can be
   disabled in the <b>Loading and Saving</b> pane of the
   <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b>
   dialog box; see <a href="global-opts.html" title="The Global Options Dialog Box">the section called &#8220;The Global Options Dialog Box&#8221;</a>.
  </p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>The edit server and security</b></p><p>
    Not only does the server pick a random TCP port number on startup,
    it also requires that clients provide an <i>authorization
    key</i>; a randomly-generated number only accessible to
    processes running on the local machine.
    So not only will &#8220;bad guys&#8221; have to guess a 64-bit integer,
    they will need to get it right on the first try; the edit server
    shuts itself off upon receiving an invalid packet.
   </p><p>
    In environments that demand absolute security, the edit server can be
    disabled by specifying the <b><tt>-noserver</tt></b> command line switch.
