<h2>

1. <a name="Target Operating Environments"></a> Target Operating Environments</h2>



<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is "pure" Java&trade; code and has no direct dependence on the 
  underlying operating system. The chief dependence is therefore on the Java 2 
  Platform itself. The 2.0 release of the Eclipse Project is written and
compiled against 
  version 1.3 of the Java 2 Platform APIs, and targeted to run on either version 
  1.3 or 1.4 of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition.</p>

<p> Eclipse SDK 2.0 has been tested and validated on the following Java 
  2 Platform implementations:</p>

<h4>

Internationalization</h4>

<p> The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
  The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including 
  dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided 
  as the default resource bundles.</p>



<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all of the above operating 
  environments; DBCS and BIDI locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK only 
  on Windows operating environments.
<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030, the new Chinese code page standard, 
  on Windows 2000 and XP only. Note that GB 18030 also requires locale and character 
  encoding support from the Java 2 Runtime Environment; this support is standard 
  in version 1.4, and also available in some 1.3 JREs.
<p> German and Japanese locales have been tested.

<h4>

BIDI support</h4>

<p> The Eclipse SDK 2.0 is a development environment targeted at technical professionals 
  - not an end user application. However, the Eclipse SDK 2.0 tools will permit 
  technical professionals who are working in English to build Hebrew/Arabic end 
  user Java programs which are themselves not based on the Eclipse SDK. The BIDI 
  support in the Eclipse SDK 2.0 allows a Java programmer to work with BIDI strings, 
  code comments, etc. but the Eclipse SDK itself is not designed to be localized 
  for BIDI locales and its widget orientation can not be changed.</p>

<p><i>IMPORTANT: The above BIDI support is available only on Windows platforms.</i></p>

<h2>

2. <a name="Compatibility with Previous Release"></a> Compatibility with Previous Release</h2>

The Eclipse SDK 2.0 is upwards compatible with the Eclipse SDK 1.0 to the 
greatest extent possible. We have made exceptions in areas where slavishly 
maintaining compatibility would not be in the best interests of the Platform or 
its clients. These exceptions are noted below, so that 
clients can assess the impact of these changes on their plug-ins and products.

<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> The Eclipse SDK 2.0 is upwards contract-compatible 
  with the Eclipse SDK 1.0 unless noted. This means that programs in full compliance 
  with contracts specified in the Eclipse SDK 1.0 APIs will automatically be in 
  full compliance with the Eclipse SDK 2.0 APIs. (API is construed broadly to 
  include such things as plug-in extension points.) Downward contract compatibility 
  is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with the Eclipse SDK 
  2.0 APIs would ensure compliance with the Eclipse SDK 1.0 APIs. 
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> The Eclipse SDK 2.0 is upwards 
  binary-compatible with the Eclipse SDK 1.0 unless noted. This means that plug-ins 
  built for the Eclipse SDK 1.0 will continue to work correctly in the Eclipse 
  SDK 2.0 without change. Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins 
  for the Eclipse SDK 2.0 are unlikely to be usable in the Eclipse SDK 1.0. Plug-ins 
  with hard-coded references in their plug-in manifest file to 1.0 versions of 
  prerequisite Eclipse Project plug-ins will not work in 2.0 as the plug-in version 
  numbers will be incompatible. 
<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> The Eclipse SDK 2.0 is upwards source-compatible 
  with the Eclipse SDK 1.0 unless noted. This means that source files written 
  to use the Eclipse SDK 1.0 APIs can be successfully compiled and run against 
  the Eclipse SDK 2.0 APIs. Since source incompatibilities are easy to deal with, 
  maintaining source compatibility is considered much less important than maintaining 
  contract and binary compatibility. Downward source compatibility is not supported. 
  If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier 
  version of the Eclipse SDK. 
<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 2.0 is upwards

workspace-compatible with Eclipse SDK 1.0 unless noted. This means that

workspaces and projects created with Eclipse SDK 1.0 can be successfully opened by Eclipse SDK

2.0 and upgraded to a 2.0 workspace.&nbsp; Individual plug-ins developed for

Eclipse SDK 1.0 should provide similar upwards compatibility for their workspace

metadata; plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their plug-ins

recognize 1.0 metadata and process it appropriately.&nbsp; Note: the interim

Eclipse SDK 1.0 plug-ins (ones with provisional APIs) are unlikely to automatically

upgrade their metadata to 2.0. User interface session state may be discarded
when a workspace is upgraded.&nbsp; Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created

(or opened) by Eclipse SDK 2.0 will be unusable with an earlier version

of Eclipse SDK.

<p><b>Note on non-compliant usage</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and certainly 
  everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are considered 
  implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are 
  subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend on anything 
  other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently unsupportable 
  and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single release much less 
  with an earlier release. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How 
  to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant 
  plug-ins.

<h3>
Platform -
UI</h3>

<p>The public client API has been kept stable with the exception of <code>ITextViewer</code>
interface which changed in an incompatible way:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added method <code>ITextViewer.invalidateTextPresentation()</code></li>
  <li>Added method <code>ITextViewer.setDefaultPrefixes(String[] defaultPrefixes,
    String contentType)</code></li>
  <li>Removed method <code>ITextViewer.setDefaultPrefix(String defaultPrefix,
    String contentType)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a known problem with runtime compatibility (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=13926">bug
13926</a>). To work around this, classes that implement the <code>IContextInformationValiditor</code>
interface should also implement <code>IContextInformationPresenter</code>.</p>

<h3>Platform - Debug</h3>
<p>The debug API has been completely reworked for 2.0. The new APIs are not
compatible with the 1.0 APIs, which were all considered &quot;interim&quot;.</p>
<p>The high level API differences between the new and old debug platforms are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Breakpoints - In 1.0, breakpoints were implemented as markers. In 2.0,
    breakpoints are implemented as objects (interface <code>IBreakpoint</code>),
    with an associated marker used for presentation in editors, and persistence
    of attributes. There is a new extension point for registering types of
    breakpoints: <code>org.eclipse.debug.core.breakpoints</code>.</li>
  <li>Launch Configurations - In 1.0, an <code>ILauncher</code> was used to
    launch applications. In 2.0, the concept of a &quot;launcher&quot; has been
    replaced with a launch configuration. There are new extension points to
    register launch configuration types, and for comparing launch
    configurations (<code>org.eclipse.debug.core.launchConfigurationTypes</code>,
    <code>org.eclipse.debug.core.launchConfigurationComparators</code>). The
    associated interfaces are <code>ILaunchConfigurationType</code>, <code>ILaunchConfiguration</code>,
    <code>ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy</code>, and <code>ILaunchConfigurationDelegate</code>.</li>
  <li>Launch Configuration Tab Groups - In 1.0, wizards were registered with
    launchers for launch related UI. In 2.0, the launch configuration dialog and
    launch shortcuts replace launch wizards. The associated extension points are
    <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchConfigurationTabGroups</code>, <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchConfigurationTypeImages</code>,
    and <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchShortcuts</code>. The associated
    interfaces are <code>ILaunchConfigurationTabGroup</code>, <code>ILaunchConfigurationTab</code>,
    and <code>ILaunchShortcut</code>.</li>
  <li>Debug model API changes - Interfaces defining the debug model elements
    have been modified, and new debug elements have been added to support
    procedural debug and expression management.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well, the Java debug model API has been enhanced and changed to reflect
changes in the debug platform.</p>

<h3>
Platform -
Core</h3>

<p>Eclipse 1.0 Core Target Management was provisional. For 2.0, Core Target Management has been withdrawn
and replaced by team target management providers. These new target management
facilities are early access, and are contained in the Eclipse FTP and WebDAV
Support feature (separately installable).
<h3>Platform - Help</h3>
<p>Help APIs and extension points were marked as interim in Eclipse 1.0. Based
on the initial feedback, the Help APIs and extension points have changed
significantly in Eclipse 2.0 and are not compatible with those in Eclipse 1.0.</p>

<h3>Platform - Scripting</h3>

<p>Eclipse 1.0 Scripting support was provisional and incomplete. For 2.0, the
Scripting component has been withdrawn completely from the Eclipse Platform.

<h3>
Platform - Install/Update</h3>

<p>The Install/Update component API has been completely reworked for 2.0. The 1.0 notion
of component has been replaced in 2.0 by the notion of a feature. The new APIs are not
compatible with the 1.0 APIs, which were all considered &quot;interim&quot;.</p>

<h3>Platform - Team</h3>
<p>Workspace compatibility from VCM CVS 1.0 to Team CVS 2.0: the meta
information for CVS providers has considerably changed from 1.0 to 2.0, and the
meta information is not being preserved. To ease migration, some automation of
migrating CVS repository locations is provided, and some helpful steps have been
included. These are described in the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-vcm-home/docs/online/cvs_features2.0/cvs-faq.html#10">Team
CVS FAQ</a>.</p>

<h3>
 PDE</h3>
<h4>Extension point schema file extension changed</h4>
<p>Extension point schema file extension has been changed from *.xsd to *.exsd
to avoid conflicts with XML schema editors and/or non-PDE schema files. PDE will
still detect files with the old extension and will issue a warning about the
change.</p>
<h4>Support for components removed</h4>
<p>Eclipse 2.0 Install/Update has discontinued the use of components
in favor of features. Consequently, PDE 2.0 supports feature-related
development while component support has been removed. Features are described in
the Eclipse Platform Plug-in Developer Guide.</p>

<h3>
3.1 <a name="I-Platform">Platform</a></h3>

<h4>Eclipse process does not exit (HP-UX only)</h4>

<p>
On HP-UX, the HP JVM process that runs the Eclipse Workbench does not terminate
upon closing the workbench. The remedy is to always pass the <code>-XdoCloseWithReadPending</code>
to the VM via the Eclipse launcher command line; that is, launch Eclipse with
the command line:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<code>eclipse -vmargs -XdoCloseWithReadPending</code></p>

Core</a></h3>

<h4><b>Invalid characters in install directory prevents Eclipse from starting</b></h4>
<p> Eclipse will fail to launch if installed in a directory whose path contains certain invalid
characters, including
:%#&lt;&gt;&quot;!. The workaround is to install Eclipse in a directory whose
path does contain invalid characters. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3109">bugs
3109</a>, <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17281">17281</a>)</p>
<h4><b>Problems with classloaders in created threads</b></h4>
<p>There is a known issue with trying to load classes from a newly created
thread using a class loader different from the plug-in class loader. The result
will be a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>. As a workaround, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Create a thread in which to run your code.</li>
  <li>Send yourThread.setContextClassLoader(yourClassLoader); // you can find
your classloader by grabbing a class it loaded (YourPluginClass.class.getClassLoader())</li>
  <li>Run your code in the newly created thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you set the context class loader for the current thread, you are competing
with other users of the thread (all of Eclipse), so the results will be unpredictable. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8907">bug
8907</a>)</p>
<h4>Deadlock creating executable extension in Plugin.startup</h4>
<p>If <code>Plugin.startup</code> code is too complex
and performs tasks such as creating an executable extension, a deadlock
situation can be created. Only simple bookkeeping tasks should be performed in <code>Plugin.startup</code>
code. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=12827">bugs 12827</a>,
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5875">5875</a>, <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16141">16141</a>)</p>
<h3>3.1.2 <a name="I-Platform - Ant">Platform - Ant</a></h3>
<h4>System.exit() in Ant task causes Eclipse to crash</h4>
<p>If an Ant script is run as an external tool or using the <b>Run Ant</b>
pop-up menu, it runs on the same Java VM as Eclipse. If the running script
execute any Ant task that calls <code>System.exit(int)</code>, Eclipse exits and
any unsaved work is lost. A workaround for these Ant tasks is to configure Ant as
an external tool. The following steps show how this is done:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Download and install the binary version of Ant from http://jakarta.apache.org/ant</li>
      <li>Click <b>Run &gt; External Tools &gt; Configure</b>.</li>
      <li>Click <b>New</b>.</li>
      <li>Enter a name for your external tool (for example, &quot;External
        Ant&quot;).</li>
      <li>Click <b>Browse File System</b>.</li>
      <li>Find and select a file called <code>ant.bat</code> (it should be in
        the bin/ folder of your Ant installation).</li>
      <li>In the <b>Tool Arguments</b> field enter the arguments for your script
        that would normally enter for running the script outside of the
        Workbench.</li>
      <li>In the <b>Working directory</b> field enter the directory of your
        script.</li>
      <li>Click <b>OK</b> to exit the wizard.</li>
      <li>To run the script, click <b>Run &gt; External Tools &gt; External Ant</b>.</li>

<h3>
3.1.3 <a name="I-Platform - Help">
Platform -
Help</a></h3>

<h4>Help documents not displayed in a browser or very slow document loading
(Windows only)</h4>
If your LAN settings are not properly configured for local host access, your
Help browser might open to a blank page or display an HTTP error instead of a
help page, or you may experience long delays when loading help documents. Your
system administrator can configure your LAN settings so that help documents can
be accessed from the local help server.
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>In the Control Panel, open <b>Internet Options</b>, select the <b>Connections</b> tab and choose
      <b>LAN Settings</b>.</li>
    <li>If your host was configured to use DHCP for IP assignment, make sure
      that the &quot;Automatically detect settings&quot; check box is cleared.</li>
    <li>If you use proxy server, ensure that the &quot;Bypass proxy server for
      local addresses&quot; is selected.</li>
    <li>In &quot;Advanced&quot; settings for proxies, add
      &quot;127.0.0.1;localhost&quot; to the &quot;Exceptions&quot; if these
      addresses are not listed.</li>
    <li>If you are using an automatic configuration script for proxy settings, and
      are not sure that the script is correct, clear the &quot;Use automatic
      configuration script&quot; check box.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If the above steps do not fix your problem, try changing the port and host
properties in <code> org.eclipse.tomcat\preferences.ini</code>. In general, setting
<code> host=localhost</code>

<h4>Working disconnected from the network (Windows only)</h4>
If you are experiencing problems when not connected to the network you must
install the loopback adapter from the Windows installation CD. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=831">bug

<h4>Using Internet Explorer in offline mode (Windows only)</h4>
If you have been using Internet Explorer in Offline mode, when you access the
help system, you will get a message indicating that the web page you requested
is not available offline. Click <b> Connect</b> to return the system behavior to normal.
<h4>Opening and navigating Help produces clicking sound (Windows only)</h4>
Internet Explorer has a sound event associated with navigate events. To turn
this sound off, go to <b> Control Panel -&gt; Sounds -&gt;Windows Explorer </b> and
change the sound for &quot;Start Navigation&quot; to &quot;none&quot; in the

<h4>Keyboard navigation in help using Mozilla</h4>
Accessibility support is limited in pre-1.0 releases of the Mozilla browser. If

<h4>Searching help produces unexpected results and highlights incomplete words</h4>
For some languages, a stemming algorithm is used to enhance the chance of a
search hit. For these languages, the word roots are searched for; exact searches are not
supported.&nbsp; As such, the result set contains
documents with variations of the search query words, and only the common roots
are highlighted in the document. Stemming and stop word removal also applies to search query terms enclosed in quotation marks (&quot;), so the
search results will not be an exact match of the quoted string. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17030">bug

<h4>Help topic tree collapse behavior (Windows only)</h4>
When the selected topic in the navigation tree is hidden,
clicking on a &quot;+&quot;/&quot;-&quot; icon to expand/collapse a node just brings the topic
into view, but does not expand/collapse the desired node. The workaround is to
either double click on the node to expand/collapse, or to click on a visible
topic and then on the &quot;+&quot;/&quot;-&quot; icon. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20887">bug

<h4>Manual refresh required when files modified outside Eclipse</h4>
<p>When files within a project are added or removed outside of Eclipse, or
when an external editor is used to modify a file within a project, a manual
refresh must be done in order for the changes to show up in the Workbench. To do
this, select the project in the Navigator view and choose <b> Refresh</b> from the
pop-up menu. This refreshes only the selected project. Alternatively, activate
the Navigator view and press F5, which refreshes all projects.</p>
<h4>Dirty state not tracked properly for OLE documents (Windows only)</h4>
<p>The dirty state for an OLE document is not updated properly. This causes
it to prompt to save the contents when the document is closed, even if the
contents have already been saved.</p>
<h4> OLE document crashes can cause Eclipse to also crash
(Windows only)</h4>
<p>If an OLE document crashes, this can cause Eclipse to either crash, or
to have workbench menus become inconsistent.</p>
<h4>Minimum display resolution</h4>
<p>A number of dialogs in Eclipse, such as the Preferences dialog, require a
minimum display resolution of at least 800 x 600. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5549">bug
5549</a>)</p>
<h4>External Tools will automatically quote path variables containing spaces</h4>
<p>When an external tool is launched, expanded path variables that contain
spaces will be enclosed in double quotes ( &quot; ). While it is typical for
Windows executables to expect paths containing spaces to be quoted, this is
known to cause problems on platforms such as Linux which do not expect these
quotes. A workaround is to make the external tool a script which strips off the
quotes before launching the executable with those parameters. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20599">bug
20599</a>)</p>
<h4>Default text file encoding may be detected incorrectly (Windows XP/2000
only)</h4>
<p>The &quot;Text file encoding&quot; value displayed in the Preferences dialog under
&quot;Editors&quot; may be wrong on platforms running Windows XP (or 2000) when
the user locale and
system locale differ.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Example of the manifestation of the bug: A Japanese user using Japanese Windows 2000 works in New York, United States.
The user has selected English (United States) as the user locale. The &quot;Text file
encoding&quot; value displayed by Eclipse is incorrect: &quot;Cp1252&quot; (English). It
should display the system locale &quot;MS932&quot; (Japanese).</p>
<p>Workaround:
The user can modify the user locale so that user locale and system locale are
identical. In the example above, this means the user should set Japanese as the
user locale. Then restart Eclipse. The &quot;Text file encoding&quot; value will then be
correct: &quot;MS932&quot; (Japanese).</p>
<p>For Windows XP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To check the system locale:
Open the Control Panel. Go to Regional and Language Options. Switch to the
    Advanced tab. The system locale is specified in &quot;Language for non-Unicode
    programs&quot;.</li>
  <li>To change the user locale:
Open the Control Panel. Go to Regional and Language Options. The user locale can
be modified by changing the language in &quot;Standards and formats&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Windows 2000:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To check the system locale:
Open the Control Panel. Go to Regional Options. Look up the items in the General
    tab, inside the &quot;Language settings for the system&quot; group. The system
locale is the item marked as (Default).</li>
  <li>To change the user locale:
Open the Control Panel. Go to Regional Options. The user locale can be modified
by changing the location in &quot;Settings for the current user&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preferred Output Level on External Tools preferences page has no effect</h4>
<p>In <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; External Tools</b>, there is a group of radio
buttons under the heading &quot;Preferred Output Level&quot; with possible
options of &quot;Information&quot;, &quot;Verbose&quot; and &quot;Debug&quot;.
Changing these values does not affect Eclipse in any way. Workaround: when
running an Ant script, use the Ant command line arguments <code>-verbose</code>
or <code>-debug</code> to get an output level other than the default
(&quot;Information&quot;). (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20817">bug
20817</a>)</p>
<h4>Ant UI in External Tools does not handle ENTITY entries in all cases</h4>
<p>Eclipse's Ant UI correctly resolves entities with URI-based system values
specifying the <code>&quot;file:&quot;</code> protocol. Other formats and
protocols, such as a relative paths, <code>&quot;http:&quot;</code> URIs, etc.
are resolved by the user's default XML parser, which can vary by JRE, user
settings, etc. Parsers such as <code>org.apache.crimson.parser</code>, for
instance, expect valid URIs only and will fail on an entity reference such as
this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;!ENTITY custom SYSTEM &quot;../../custom.xml&quot;&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workaround for this problem is to insure you add the <code>&quot;file:&quot;</code>
protocol specifier to relative paths as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;!ENTITY custom SYSTEM &quot;file:../../custom.xml&quot;&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This problem only occurs in the UI, as Eclipse's Ant execution engine uses <code>SAXParser</code>,
which correctly resolves formats such as relative paths. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20819">bug

<h4>Updating the toolbar in multi-page editors</h4>
<p>Clients of action bars may create a number of <code>SubToolBarManagers</code>
on their <code>IToolBarManager</code>  (e.g., multipage editor). The client will
typically make one <code>SubToolBarManager</code>  visible, the rest invisible,
and call <code>updateActionBars</code>. The visibility of the items may not
update correctly.</p>
<p>A workaround is for the client to explicitly update the toolbar:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>actionBars.updateActionBars();<br>
  actionBars.getToolBarManager().update(false);</code></p>

<b>
<p>Available colors on 8-bit Linux (Linux only)</p>
</b>
<p>Typically, in Gnome Linux installs running with 8-bit visuals (i.e. 256 color
mode), before the Eclipse application is started you already do not have any
free colors. This may mean that Eclipse is unable to allocate the default widget
background color, causing it to display a white background. The functionality,
however, is otherwise unaffected.</p>
<b>
<p>Printing support (Linux only)</p>
</b>
<p>The X printing extension implementation on Linux is currently disabled
because it can take up to 7 seconds to determine that the X print server is not
running. Until this is rectified, <code>Printer.getPrinterList()</code> will
always return an empty array on Linux. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8821">bug

<b>
<p>Disposing in a focus event</p>
</b>
<p>Applications should not dispose widgets in focus changing events. Doing so on
Motif may cause Eclipse to terminate, since Motif accesses the disposed widget
within their internal focus change event handler. A similar (but less serious)
issue exists on Windows and occasionally results in an SWT exception being thrown.</p>
<b>
<p>List and ComboBox on Windows NT (Windows NT only)</p>
</b>
<p>On Windows NT only, you should avoid creating items in a <code> List</code> or
<code> ComboBox</code>
with strings longer than 1000 characters. Doing so may result in a General
Protection Fault. This has been fixed in more recent versions of Windows.</p>
<b>
<p>BiDi support</p>
</b>
<p>The <code> StyledText</code> widget provides bidirectional language support for Hebrew and
Arabic locales. Currently this support is available only on Windows and has
several known problems.</p>
<b>
<p>Cursor constructor arguments</p>
</b><p>In the constructor <code> Cursor(Device device,
ImageData source, ImageData mask, int hotspotX, int hotspotY)</code>,
when both a source and mask argument are specified (that is, the mask is not null), the
meaning of the two arguments is reversed. That is, the &quot;mask&quot; argument
should be the source image and the &quot;source&quot; argument should be the
mask image. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4809">bug 4809</a>)</p>

You can workaround this problem by adding the SWT library directory to your

<b>
<p>Missing permissions for SWT native libraries in workspace (HP-UX only)</p>
</b>
<p>When retrieving the SWT Motif fragment into an Eclipse workspace, the
permissions of the native libraries are reset. This creates a problem on
HP-UX because shared libraries need to have execute permission. Attempting to
self-host with this fragment throws an UnsatisfiedLinkError...Permission Denied
error. You must manually change the permissions to make these libraries accessible
(assume the workspace is at <code>/workspace</code>):</p>

<p>Because of a bug in the way we updated the javadoc in SWT source code, the
javadoc for protected methods is not consistent across platforms. The javadoc
for the Windows platform, which is used to generate the documentation that
appears in the Platform Plug-in Developer guide, is the definitive source. The

<h4>No accelerators or mnemonics on Solaris (Solaris only)</h4>
</b>
<p>The Solaris implementation of Motif has a long-standing bug with respect to
adding and removing accelerators and mnemonics. The behavior is such that the
time to do so becomes increasingly longer each time it occurs, to the point
that, in Eclipse's case, it can take more than a minute to switch between
editors and views! Because of this, accelerators and mnemonics are explicitly
ignored on Solaris.</p>

<h4>Cannot perform CVS operations on a project that was renamed</h4>
<p>If a project under CVS control is renamed, certain CVS operations will fail.
To work around this problem, first select <b> Team &gt; Disconnect</b> from the popup
menu of the project in the navigator and choose to keep the CVS folders. Then,
choose <b> Team &gt; Share Project </b> to re-share the project with CVS. Exiting and
restarting Eclipse also clears up the problem. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=21036">bug
21036</a>)</p>
<h4>&quot;extssh&quot; is not a supported command line method</h4>
<p>Since the &quot;extssh&quot; connection method is not a supported command line method,
you cannot use the command line tool when a project uses this method. Instead,
use the Eclipse supported &quot;ext&quot; method and set the appropriate environment
variables so that the command line tool will work. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=7943">bug

<h4>Connection cannot be found after initially missing</h4>
<p>If a connection initially fails due to a network problem, the connection may continue to fail even when the network problem is fixed. In order to
establish the connection you must exit and restart Eclipse. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9295">bug

<h4>CVS meta-folders appear in some cases</h4>
<p>There are some cases where setting folders as team private won't hide them
from the UI as the user would expect. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=12386">bug

<h4>&quot;Received broken pipe signal&quot; error from server</h4>
<p>Eclipse sometime performs multiple commands within a single connection to the

in response to certain commands. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=15490">bug

help. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=15724">bug 15724</a>)</p>
<h4>Team &gt; Update does not indicate that there are outgoing changes</h4>
<p>The <b>Team &gt; Update</b> command will load all remote changes into your local working copy. If you
are using <b>Team &gt; Update</b> and you want to see which files have outgoing changes,
open the CVS console before performing the update. The console will show the
results of the update (which files had mergeable conflicts, which ones had
unmergeable conflicts and which ones had outgoing changes). <b>Warning</b>:
Only use <b>Team &gt; Update</b> if you know CVS. If there are &quot;real&quot; conflicts
(i.e., those that affect the same line of a file) then CVS will add markup to the
file during the update. Resolving these conflicts in this manner is not
pleasant. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16750">bug

<h4>Synchronize view &quot;Mark as Merged&quot; has surprising behavior with
respect to modes</h4>
<p>When you <b>Mark as Merged</b>, if its your only incoming change and you

like the change is gone. However, your change will appear in outgoing mode. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18513">bug

<h4>Team &gt; Commit on an unchanged file does not update decorator</h4>
<p>If you perform a <b> Team &gt; Commit</b> on a file that has been modified but whose
contents match the contents of the file on the server, the file will remain on
outgoing change. To correct the problem, either perform a <b> Team &gt; Update</b> or
use the Synchronize view to commit. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18647">bug

<h4>Change ASCII/Binary Properties not available for unadded files</h4>
<p>The <b> Change ASCII/Binary Properties</b> menu item is only enabled for files and

<h4>Error updating incoming directory additions with pruning turned off</h4>
<p>If pruning is turned off and a project has incoming nested folder additions
that do not contain any files, performing an update in the Synchronize view will
result in an error (cannot create folder). The workaround is to perform a <b> Team
&gt; Update</b> which will bring in the directories. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19442">bug

<h4>&quot;Remove from View&quot; in Synchronize view does not exclude resources

<h4>CVS automatically prunes empty directories</h4>
<p>By default, empty directories will be pruned on checkout and update. This is
desirable in most cases as directories on a CVS server are never deleted.

auto-pruning. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20463">bug

<h4>ClassCastException on attempt to replace directory with file</h4>
<p>Performing the following steps will result in the above exception:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new project &amp; share it with a CVS repository.</li>
  <li>Create a directory in the project root and a file inside this directory.</li>
  <li>Synchronize the project using <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>.</li>
  <li>Locally delete the directory (and contained file) that was just created</li>
  <li>Create a file in the project root with the same name as the directory that
    was just deleted.</li>
  <li>Synchronize again using <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The workaround is to commit the folder deletion before creating the new file.

<h4>Still prompted if delete unmanaged preference turned off</h4>
<p>If the &quot;delete unmanaged resources on replace&quot; preference has been
disabled on the <b>Team &gt; CVS</b> preference page and a <b>Team &gt; Replace
With</b> operation is performed on a project that has one unmanaged resource and
no other outgoing changes, the user is prompted to overwrite local changes even
though the operation will not overwrite the unmanaged resource. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18834">bug

<h4>Hidden CVS/ folders get copied when copying folders from one project to another</h4>
<p>If you copy a folder that is under CVS control to a folder that is not, the <code>
CVS/</code> folders (usually not shown) will be copied as well. This can cause problems if the target project is under
CVS control and you try to add the moved folder to CVS control. The workaround
is to manually delete the <code> CVS/</code> subdirectories using the file system browser,
or
disconnect the source project from CVS control before copying the folders. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20621">bug

<h4>Update with incoming deletion and addition involving file with different
case fails (Windows only)</h4>
<p>On update, if there are incoming deletions for one or more
files and incoming additions for files of the same name with a different case,
then the operation may fail on Windows depending on what order the server sends the files
in. Workaround is to update the deletions first and then the additions using the

<p>Under some conditions, the <b>Refresh</b> action in the Feature Updates view
will not actually refresh the content of an update site after a change. Exit and
restart the Eclipse to correct this condition. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20811">bug
20811</a>)
<p><b>Accessing update sites through a proxy</b>
<p>To access an update site through a proxy, you will need to start the
workbench with the following command line options:
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>eclipse -vmargs -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=&lt;proxy_name&gt; -DproxyPort=&lt;proxy_port&gt;</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>as documented in <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip42.html.">JavaWorld
Tip 42</a>. Proxies requiring user authentication are currently not supported. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19717">bug
19717</a>)</p>
<p><b>URL validity checking on input</b>
<p>URL syntax is currently not completely checked on input. Ensure that any
entered URLs use the correct separators (eg. forward&nbsp; slash '/') and do not
contain invalid characters. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19685">bugs

<p><b>Running &quot;headless&quot; applications that do not handle restart</b>
<p>When install changes are detected, the changes are automatically processed
and the workbench restarts. The executable launcher supplied with the
application correctly handles the restart. However, if you have applications
that directly call the platform (eg. by calling the BootLoader APIs) and do not
handle restart, the startup reconciliation processing can be suppressed by
specifying <tt>-noupdate</tt> command line option. In this case, the application
will start with the set of features and plug-ins that were processed and
configured on the previous start. If prior configuration cannot be found, the
application will start with the full set of plug-ins found in the installation
location.

<h4>Running Java programs with non-Latin-1 characters in package or class names</h4>
You get a <code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError</code> when running Java programs
with non-Latin characters in the package or class names. The workaround is to
package the class files as a JAR file and run the program out of the JAR and not
from the file system directly. (<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4181">bug
4181</a>)
<h4>Missing debug attributes</h4>
The debugger requires that class files be compiled with debug attributes if it
is to be able to display line numbers and local variables. Quite often, class
libraries (for example, &quot;<code>rt.jar</code>&quot;) are compiled without
complete debug attributes, and thus local variables and method arguments for
those classes are not visible in the debugger.
<h4>Setting breakpoints</h4>
In general the debugger will not allow you to place breakpoints on lines of code
that are not executable (comments, blank lines, etc.). However, there are some
cases where the debugger will allow breakpoints on lines of code that are not
executable. For example, the debugger will allow a breakpoint to be placed on a
variable declaration that does not contain an initializer (&quot;int x;&quot;).
Note that enabled breakpoints which are successfully installed on an executable
line in a running (debuggable) VM are displayed with a checkmark. Breakpoints
that are displayed without a checkmark are not installed in a running (debuggable)
VM.
<h4>Using Hot Code Replace</h4>
Hot code replace is supported on JDK 1.4.x VMs, and IBM J9 VMs. Hot code replace
is limited to changes which do not effect the shape of a class. That is, changes
within existing methods are supported, but the addition or removal of members is
not supported.
<p>Hot code replace and stepping on JDK 1.4.0 VMs is unreliable. This appears to
be a VM issue that should be fixed in later releases of the JDK.</p>
<h4>Scrapbook</h4>
Setting a breakpoint inside a scrapbook page is not supported.
<p>When a snippet is run in the scrapbook which directly or indirectly calls <code>System.exit(int)</code>,
the evaluation cannot be completed, and will result in a stack trace for a <code>com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException</code>
being displayed in the scrapbook editor.
<p>Terminating a scrapbook page while it is performing an evaluation results in
a <code>com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException</code> being displayed in the
scrapbook editor.
<h4>Debugging over slow connections</h4>
A global Java debug preference specifies the debugger timeout, which is the
maximum amount of time the debugger waits for a response from the target VM
after making a request of that VM. Slow connections may require that this value
be increased. The timeout value can be edited from the <b>Java &gt; Debug </b>preference
page. Changing the timeout value only effects subsequently launched VM, not VMs
that are already running.
<h4>Updating of inspected values</h4>
When inspecting the result of an evaluated expression in the debugger, it is
important to note that the result displayed is the result of that expression at
the time it was evaluated. For example, when inspecting a simple integer counter
(primitive data type), the value displayed in the Expressions view is the value
when the expression was evaluated. As the counter is changed in the running
program, the inspected result will not change (since the view is not displaying
the value bound to a variable - it is displaying the value of an expression, and
the value of a primitive data type cannot change). However, if an expression
results in an object, fields of that object will be updated in the inspector as
they change in the running program (since the value bound to fields in an object
can change).
<h4>Stepping over native methods that perform I/O</h4>
When the debugger steps over native methods that perform I/O to <code>System.out</code>
or <code>System.err</code>, the output may not appear immediately unless the
native performs a flush on the output buffer.
<h4>VM and process termination running on IBM 1.3 JVM on Linux (Linux only)</h4>
Terminating a launch, debug target, or system process associated with a debug
target running on the IBM 1.3 JVM on the Linux platform does not work when the
associated debug target has a suspended thread. To remove such debug targets
from the debug UI, select <b>Terminate and Remove</b> from the debug view's
pop-up menu (or use the shortcut &quot;delete&quot; key). Associated system
processes in the OS may not be properly cleaned up. If a debug target has no
suspended threads, termination works properly.
<h4>Searching for constant field references</h4>
Search does not find references to constant fields inside binaries because the
Java Language Specification mandates that constant field values be inlined in
the class file's bytecodes, leaving no trace of a field reference.&nbsp;(<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=12044">bug
12044</a>)
<h4>Java compilation units outside of the build class path</h4>
When a compilation unit with compilation problems is moved outside the Java
build class path, it retains its Java problems forever (its compilation problem
list does not get refreshed because it will never be compiled again). Renaming a
*.java file to one with another a different file extension suffix causes the
same problem. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=13008">bug
13008</a>)
<h4>Refactoring operations update references in the entire workspace</h4>
Refactoring operations always update references in the entire workspace. This
can be more than what is needed and expected. For example, when you have the
same project twice in your workspace and you perform a rename refactoring in one
of the projects, then the references in the other project will be updated as
well.
<h4>Actions to modify read-only files</h4>
Actions on the <b>Source</b> menu (e.g., <b>Generate Getter and Setter</b>) are
always disabled when the file is read-only. This is currently true even when the
repository provider supports automatically checking out files on modification. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17600">bug
17600</a>)
<h4>Java code templates</h4>
<p>You cannot use <code>${CURSOR}</code> inside of a comment in a Java code
template (<b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Templates</b>). (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19556">bug
19556</a>)</p>
<h4>Organize import and imports from default packages</h4>
<p>Organize import does not handle imports from default packages. Note that
importing from a default package is no longer supported in JDK 1.4. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19487">bug
19487</a>)</p>
<h4>Add Javadoc action for fields</h4>
<p>The <b>Add Javadoc</b> action does not work for fields. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20259">bug
20259</a>)</p>
<h4>Javadoc hover in the Java editor</h4>
<p>The Javadoc hover help shown when hovering over identifiers in the Java
editor does not handle links inside of Javadoc comments properly. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20644">bug
20644</a>)</p>

3.3 <a name="I-Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)">Plug-in Development
Environment (PDE)</a></h3>

<h4>Comments in source pages of PDE XML editors</h4>
<p>PDE provides a number of multi-page editors that include a raw source page.
Editors that handle XML files (plug-in, fragment and feature manifests) will
preserve comments in most cases. However, comments will not be preserved if
added before the root XML element,
or if added after the last child element contained in the parent element. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8000">bug
8000</a>)</p>
<h4>Clipboard operations in the property view</h4>
<p>Clipboard shortcuts (Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V etc.) do not work in cell editors
of properties that belong to the PDE Plug-in Manifest Editor. Use pop-up menu to
activate these operations. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=13776">bug
13776</a>)</p>
<h4>Problem while importing fragments</h4>
<p>If a workspace contains binary projects for a plug-in and a fragment that
references that plug-in, fragment libraries are added to the class path of the
referenced plug-in project. When an attempt is made to overwrite the plug-in and
the fragment with versions from another build, deletion of the old fragment may
fail. If that happens, repeat the operation to repair the workspace. Only the
affected plug-in and fragment need to be re-imported. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16921">bug
16921</a>)</p>
<h4>Assumption that output is in bin/ folder</h4>
<p>PDE assumes that all plug-in and fragment projects that contain Java code
have one or more source folders and build output in the <b>bin/</b> folder. Although
it is possible to change the name of the output folder in Properties dialog, the
PDE
run-time workbench launcher does not work correctly for those plug-ins. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17444">bug
17444</a>)</p>
<h4>Preferences not working with import/export</h4>
<p>Preferences set in PDE preference page called <b>Target Platform</b> are not
preserved the same way as other preferences. Consequently, they are not subject
to Import/Export operations in the Preferences dialog. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19688">bug
19688</a>)</p>
<h4>Clipboard operations do not work in the Feature Manifest Editor</h4>
<p>GUI pages of the Feature Manifest Editor support pop-up menus that contain
standard clipboard operations (<b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b>, <b>Paste</b>). However, none of these
operations work for structural widgets (trees and lists). The only place where
these operations do work is in text widgets in Information and Source page (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20460">bug
20460</a>)</p>
<h4>Choosing Compute Build Path causes Java project to no longer
build</h4>
<p>PDE computes the build class path of a plug-in project by looking up source mappings in
the <code>build.properties</code>  file. This file defines how source folders are compiled into
runtime libraries. In the absence of this file, PDE will compute the class
path that contains no source folders, resulting in compilation errors. The
required <code>
build.properties</code> file is generated by PDE when a new plug-in project is
created. If the
plug-in project is created in some other way, a <code>build.properties</code> file must be
added manually. See the PDE Guide for details on the format of <code>
build.properties</code> files. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9765">bug
9765</a>)</p>
<h4>ECLIPSE_HOME produces fragile class paths due to version numbers in plug-in
directory paths</h4>
<p>Eclipse products are typically built so that plug-ins are located in the same
directory and each plug-in is in the directory whose name includes both a
plug-in id and a version id (e.g., &quot;<code>org.eclipse.ui_2.0.0</code>&quot;). If external plug-ins are used while self-hosting, these plug-in
directory names show up in PDE-generated class paths. These class path are
sensitive to plug-in version changes and must be recomputed if the target platform
uses different version numbers. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=15199">bug
15199</a>)</p>
<h4>Plug-in import wizard does not allow plug-ins of different versions to be
imported</h4>
<p>The Eclipse platform allows two plug-ins with the same ID but different versions
to coexist if the only thing they contribute is run-time libraries. However, PDE
cannot handle these plug-ins because it creates project names using plug-in IDs
during binary project import. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18500">bug
18500</a>)</p>
<h4>PDE nature required for plug-in manifest syntax checking</h4>
<p>PDE will only be able to provide syntax checking and error/warning markers
for plug-in manifests if the plug-in project has the PDE plug-in nature. A plug-in
project automatically gets this nature when created by a PDE wizard. This
situation can only occur if a regular Java project has been used to host a
plug-in. The problem can be fixed by converting it into a PDE project. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19248">bug
19248</a>)</p>
<h4>PDE does not preserve original manifest file layout</h4>
<p>When non-Source page of a PDE manifest editor is used, PDE will convert
changes back into XML by regenerating the file. Although the overall content and
the comments are preserved, the actual file layout is not. This may cause
problems by showing false changes during file compare. If file layout is
important, perform all editing in the Source page. Alternatively, avoid using
Source pages altogether. Since XML files are generated in a way that respects
and preserves the relative order of major elements
(extensions, extension points etc.), changes made in a non-Source page of a PDE
manifest editor do not result
in false deltas during file compare. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19251">bug
19251</a>)</p>
<h4>Go To Line in manifest editor causes Outline view to go blank </h4>
<p>When the <b>Source &gt; Go To Line</b> command is invoked in the Source page of
a PDE manifest editor, the Outline view will become gray. Since the Source page does not have
a functional outline, there is no actual loss of function. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19361">bug
19361</a>)</p>
<h4>New Feature wizard does not generate build.properties file</h4>
<p>When creating a new feature project, the PDE wizard does not automatically
generate a <code>build.properties</code> file. As a result, building the feature will create
a feature JAR without any content. To work around this, create a <code>build.properties</code> manually
using the instructions provided in the PDE Guide. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20118">bug
20118</a>)</p>
<h4>Update Classpath attaches source from the wrong Eclipse install</h4>
<p>Java libraries are associated with source code according to source code
locations specified in a PDE preference. By default, these locations are
registered by plug-ins of the design-time Eclipse instance. If the target
platform is not the same as the design instance, the source code provided by
these plug-ins will not be in sync with the libraries. The workaround is to
uncheck the default locations and define new source code locations that point to
the source-bearing plug-ins in the target Eclipse installation. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20578">bug
20578</a>)</p>
<h4>No way to specify plug-in library type</h4>
<p>PDE manifest editors do not provide widgets for specifying run-time library
types as being either &quot;code&quot; or &quot;resource&quot;. The only way to
specify this attribute is to add it manually in the source page. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20757">bug
20757</a>)</p>

<h4>Run-time libraries exported through more than 2 plug-ins not in classpath</h4>
<p>If a plug-in requires a runtime library exported through more than two
plug-ins, it is not automatically added to the compile class path when generating
the <code>build.xml</code> file. Example: Plug-in A export its libraries,
plug-in B requires plug-in A and re-exports A, plug-in C requires plug-in B and
re-exports B. If plug-in D requires plug-in C, when generating the <code>build.xml</code>
file, plug-in A libraries will not be added to the compile path even though they
will be available at runtime. The problem can be worked around as follows::</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Generate a <code>build.xml</code> using PDE (select the <code>plugin.xml</code>
      file and click <b>Create Plug-in JARs</b>)</li>
    <li>Edit the <code>build.properties</code> and add the following line:<code><br>
      custom = true</code></li>
    <li>Add the missing JARs to the classpath of the javac task in <code>build.xml</code>.</li>
  </ol>

<h4>When mapped to a target, the project folder is ignored</h4>
<p>Ignoring the project folder is by design. Normally with target management you put/get the
contents of the project, not the actual project. The place you pick in the site
explorer is where the project contents will go. This allows your local project
to have a different name than the container in the WebDAV/FTP server. If you
want to map several projects to the same site location, you create a new folder
for each one. This is why &quot;New Folder&quot; is in the mapping page. (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17657">bug

<h4>When setting the target site of a project, reselecting the same location

<p>Using <b>Deploy &gt; Target Site</b> on a project that is already deployed

<h4>FTP messages cause an exception</h4>

<h4>FTP download fails with deep directory structure</h4>
