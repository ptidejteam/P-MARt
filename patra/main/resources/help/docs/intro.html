<p>Password Tracker is an application to keep your passwords in an encrypted file on disk, protected by a pass phrase so
    that they are safe. Even if the file containing your passwords falls in the wrong hands, the pass phrase is needed
    to decrypt it. The application uses the unpatented Blowfish encryption algorithm which was invented by Bruce
    Schneier. The encryption is reasonably safe. The application is based on the Password Safe application from
    Bruce Schneier, it aims to be compatible with it. The application is available under the
    <a href="pwt-license.html">GNU GPL</a>.</p>

<h2>History and Goal</h2>


<p>I started using the original Password Safe application from Bruce Schneier, which was a native windows application,
    and I still find it very useful. I try to maintain a number of different computers running different OS's. On Linux
    I am using WINE to run password safe. I didn't want to be "locked in" in an old format that I didn't
    understand, I was afraid my data would get lost at some point. Therefore, I wanted to be able to decode the file
    format myself to be able to recover my data if this would be necessary. Some things were bothering me a little bit
    regarding the application.</p>

<ul>
    <li>No easy buttons to copy uid/pwd (both, not only the password).</li>
    <li>Cross platform - no dependency on WINE - PC, Linux, OSX.</li>
    <li>New password safe format 2.0.</li>
    <li>Import/export to plain text to prevent lock-in.</li>
    <li>Changing the password generating stuff, sometimes I need longer/shorter passwords with other requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>Idea of the application comes from the Password Safe application. This was first written by Bruce Schneier, and than
    transferred to the open source community. It is now available at: http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net. The Password
    Safe project was important to know the file format, especially the header format which is not trivial.</p>


<p>I found some more information about the file format in another open source project which is also based on the
    Password Safe application. It is the Password Safe password database application which can be found at:
    http://nsd.dyndns.org/pwsafe.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The classification system (11 categories) comes from a script written by David Finch. The generator algorithm
        does not, I wrote this myself.
