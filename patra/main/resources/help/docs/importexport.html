<h1>Import/Export</h1>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>Password Tracker lets you import/export your passwords to general accepted text formats in order to assure you that
    your data is not locked in a propriety format. Comma Separated Values (CSV) and Extended Markup Language are
    supported. Note that exporting your data to one of these formats is inherently dangerous, your passwords become
    unprotected. You should do this with care, don't let the exported data linger around.</p>

<h2> Importing data</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Existing safe</li>
    <li>CSV</li>
    <li>XML</li>
</ul>

<h2> Exporting data</h2>

<ul>
    <li>CSV</li>
    <li>XML</li>
</ul>

<p>As you might have noticed, the export menu does not contain the normal password safe format. This is because you an
    always do a "save as". This has the same functionality.</p>
