Idea of the application comes from the "Password Safe" application. This was first written by Bruce Shneier, and than
transferred to the open source community. It is now available at: http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net.
The password safe project was important to know the file format, especially the header format.

I found some more information about the file format in another open source project which is also based on the
Password Safe application. It is the pwsafe password database application which can be found at: http://nsd.dyndns.org/pwsafe.

Password generator:
* The classification system (11 categories) comes from a script written by David Finch. The generator algorithm does not.

Encryption:
* Written from scratch based on the example provided by Bruce Schneier in the book: "Applied Cryptography".

GOAL
====

I started using the original password safe application from Bruce Schneier and I still find it very useful.
I try to maintain a number of different computers running different OS's. On Linux I am using WINE to run password safe.
I don't want to be "locked in"  in an old format that I didn't understand, I was afraid my data would get lost
at some point. Therefore, I wanted to be able to decode the fileformat myself to be able to recuperate my data if this would
be necessary. Some things were bothering me a bit regarding the application.

 * No easy buttons to copy uid/pwd (both, not only the password).
 * Cross platform - no dependency on WINE - PC, Linux, OSX.
 * New password safe format 2.0.
 * Import/export to plain text to prevent lock-in.
 * Changing the password generating stuff, sometimes I need longer/shorter passwords with other requirements.

The current password safe project hosts a Java version as well but I decided not to investigate this solution further.
I noticed that there has been progress on the Java version since I started my own implementation, but since, but I did not
investigate it anymore. The remarks might not be valid anymore at this point in time.

 * Code not clear and clean.
 * I am in Java myself.
 * Dependency on external libs.

So I decided to rewrite the complete application from scratch without reusing code. Simple to install, clean lean interface,
a handy polished tool.
