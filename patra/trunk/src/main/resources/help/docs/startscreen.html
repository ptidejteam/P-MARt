<h1> Start Screen</h1>

<p><img src="../assets/ss-1.jpg"></p>

<p>The start screen has two main functions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create new safe files.</li>
  <li>Open existing safe files.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this is the first time you start the application, you can also have
a look at the <a href="quickstart.html">Quick start</a>
page. It explains in detail how to create a new password safe.</p>

<h2>Create new safe files</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Enter the path of a new safe (text box 1). The filename should not exist. If there already is a file with the
        same name, Password Tracker will try to open it, so you first have to remove or rename the existing file. Note:
        if you do not add an extension, the application will assume a ".dat" extension. This behavior can be modified in
        the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>. You can use the browse button to interactively select a file and
        its location (button 2).
    </li>
    <li>Enter the pass phrase of the new safe (text box 3).</li>
    <li>Click the "Go" button (button 4).</li>
</ol>

<p>You can always abort the application by clicking button 5 "Cancel".
Clicking the "Help" button (button 6) will start the on line help system.</p>

<p>The application will ask a confirmation that it is your intention to
create a new safe. If you confirm this, a new empty safe will be
created. You will be redirected to the <a href="mainscreen.html">main
screen</a> You can start adding new entries and save your data.</p>

<h2> Open existing safe files</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Enter the path of an existing safe (text box 1). The file
        should exist. Note: if you do not add an extension, the application
        will assume a ".dat" extension. This behavior can be modified in the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>. You
        can use the browse button to interactively select a file and its
        location (button 2).
    </li>
    <li>Enter the pass phrase to unlock the file (text box 3)</li>
    <li>Click the Go button.</li>
</ol>

<p>The application will start unlocking the file using the pass phrase. You will be redirected to the
   <ahref="mainscreen.html">main screen</a>.</p>
