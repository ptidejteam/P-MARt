<h1>Tips</h1>
<h2>Using the Context Menu</h2>

<p>After selecting a record, you can use the context menu (right click) to perform some actions on this record.
The menu will also contain a list of URL's from the notes. The application will automatically scan the associated notes
for the presence of any URL and add this to the context menu. This allows you to quickly go to a website associated
with the password entry.</p>

<h2>Stay on top</h2>

<p>The menu "view" contains a checkbox "stay on top". This option works as a toggle. By selecting it, the password
    tracker window will stay on top of all other windows. When visiting a website (which could be done via the context
    menu), you can copy-paste the userid and the password in a single sequence without having to go looking for
    the password tracker window.
</p>

<h2>Search Hilight</h2>

<p>When you type something in the search window, the matching parts will be hilighted. In this way you can see immediately
why the remaining records are there.</p>
