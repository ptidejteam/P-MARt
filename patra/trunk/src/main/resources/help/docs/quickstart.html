<h1>Quick Start </h1>

<p>The goal of this page is to get you up-and-running as fast as possible. It assumes you are running the application
    for the first time. These are the steps to follow if you first start using the application.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new password safe (database).</li>
  <li>Create a password entry.</li>
  <li>You can start copy-pasting the user id and/or the password.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to save.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Create a new password safe</h2>

<p>When you start the application this screen is shown. In order to create
a new safe, you first fill in the path to the file were you want to
store your passwords. You can use the browse button to interactively
browse through the file system. Then you provide a new pass phrase for
the file. Remember the pass phrase very carefully, there is no way to
recover your data if you forget the pass phrase. The steps are shown in
the screen shot.</p>

<p>The application will ask you if it is OK to create a new database.
Press the "Yes" to create your database. The reason that the
application asks for confirmation is that you can also use the start
screen to open an existing database. If you made a mistake in the
pathname, and you do not want to create a new file, you can recover at
this point.</p>

<p>The result is the main application window. Since you did not yet enter
any data, the screen is almost blank. In the next section we will start
entering some data.</p>

<h2>Create an entry</h2>

<p>Use the menu bar to add a new entry to the database.</p>

<h2> Copy-paste </h2>

<p>You can easily copy the user id or the password by first selecting the
entry in the table, and then clicking the quick buttons on the left and
right side of the main Password Tracker window.</p>

<h2>Save your data</h2>

<p>Finally, remember to save your data before leaving the application. No
reason to panic, if your forgot to do so, the application will issue a
warning and you can still recover at that point.</p>
