<ol>
    <li>The length of the password.</li>
    <li>If you select "readable" passwords, only characters a-z will be used. This is less safe, but it is easier to
        remember the passwords. It depends which level of security you want.
    </li>
    <li>Upper/lower case will be used if selected.</li>
    <li>Digits will be used if selected.</li>
    <li>Punctuation will be used if selected. Not all applications support such passwords.</li>
    <li>The category gives an indication of the safety level of the generated passwords. This is only indicative.</li>
</ol>

<p>The more "unreadable" you make the passwords the safer they are, but the trade-off is that they are difficult to
    remember.</p>
