Mapper
Version 1.9.2
Release Notes:

Quick Highlights
================================================================
o   Added new Button component which is a visible Trigger component.
o   Added new DocumentElement component which can be used to simply
    hide/show any Element (including children) in XML document.
o   Added Simple hyperlink component: HTMLAnchorURL
o   Added HTMLTextArea component for inputting long text.
o   ServletApp now responds with 404 if ServletForm not found.
o   Added new property on all Fields to control WHEN they receive
    their input.  Normally, they receive their input after the
    openForm method has been invoked.  Now, with the "earlyInputNotify"
    property set to true, a Field can receive its input at the
    same time the Parameter components do.  This will support the
    use of Fields which are used as parameters for the application.
o   Added new "visible" property to superclass Component. Now components
    can be hidden or shown when rendered.
o   Initial release of stand-alone code generator for MapperXML.
    The initial release will generate simple ServletApp's and
    ServletForm's using the Velocity template engine.
o   Added internal logging and debugging subsystem for Mapper. This
    logging system uses an adapter to provide actual logging.  Thus
    it can be adapted to make use of any existing logging system.

Public API Interface Changes/Deprecations:
================================================================
o   The setModel method in Parameter no longer throws a ModelException.
    A ModelException was never thrown in the implementation.
o   The setModel method in SelectField no longer throws a ModelException.
    If the wrong kind of model is passed, an IllegalArgumentException is

o   com.taursys.dom.XMLFactory - deprecated and scheduled for removal
o   HTMLInputText - Added new constructor which accepts a DataTypes.TYPE_XXX
    type for this component.

================================================================
o   Cleaned up visibility problems in DataTypes.  Numerous internal
    variables and methods were exposed - changed to private.
o   com.taursys.xml.Container changed return type of method
    getRenderDispatcher() from Dispatcher to RenderDispatcher.

New Features:
================================================================
o   Added new Button component which is a visible Trigger component.
o   Added Simple hyperlink component: HTMLAnchorURL
o   Added HTMLTextArea component for inputting long text.
o   New package com.taursys.debug for logging sub-system.
o   New stand-alone code generator in com.taursys.tools
o   Added new "visible" property to Component.  This
    controls their visibility during rendering.  If they are
    set invisible, they will be removed from the Document
    during rendering, otherwise they will be left in (or
    restored if previously removed).

Other Changes:
================================================================
o   Modified Template to check for null valueHolder during rendering
    to avoid null pointer exception.  If the valueHolder is
    now null during rendering, the resulting template will
    be empty and a warning message will be issued in the
    log.
o   Modified ServletApp doGet method to respond with a 404 not found
    error if the ServletFormFactory could not find the requested
    ServletForm.  Originally it would throw an Exception if not
    found.
o   Modified ServletForm and added setters for request and
    response objects.  Other minor internal changes.
o   Modified PropertyAccessor which is used to set properties
    of Value Objects. Eliminated problem of cryptic null pointer
    exception when trying to set a primative to null.  Now there is
    a explicit exception for this condition:
    ModelPropertyAccessorException.REASON_NULL_VALUE_FOR_PRIMATIVE
o   Parameter - added method to expose to subclass whether or not
    notification has been setup yet.  Needed to support new early
    input notification feature.
o   Updated HTMLComponentFactory and ComponentFactory for new
    components.
