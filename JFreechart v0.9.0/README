-----------------
1.  INTRODUCTION
-----------------
JFreeChart is an open-source Java class library for producing charts.
It runs on the Java 2 Platform (JDK1.3 or later) and uses the Java
2D API for drawing.

JFreeChart is licensed, free of charge, under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL).  A copy of the licence is
included in the download.

Please note that JFreeChart is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Please refer refer to the licence for details.

-------------------
2.  LATEST VERSION
-------------------
The latest version of this class library can be obtained from:

    http://www.object-refinery.com/jfreechart/index.html

If you have an comments, suggestions or bugs to report, please post a
message in the JFreeChart forum.

------------------
3.  DOCUMENTATION
------------------
You can download installation instructions
(jfreechart-0.9.0-install.pdf) from the JFreeChart home
page or the project page on SourceForge.

We also raise money for the JFreeChart project by selling
documentation (electronic copies in PDF format).  Please consider
supporting this initiative so that we can continue to develop free
software - refer to the JFreeChart home page for details.

-----------------
4.  DEPENDENCIES
-----------------
JFreeChart requires JDK 1.3 or later.  In addition, it uses classes
from the JCommon class library (also available from
http://www.object-refinery.com/), version 0.6.2 or later.  The JCommon
jar file is included in the JFreeChart download, but you may want to
download JCommon separately to obtain the full source code (also under
the GNU Lesser General Public Licence).

The servlet code requires jar files from the Batik and Xerces projects
(http://xml.apache.org/).

------------------------
5. THE DEMO APPLICATION
------------------------
There is a demonstration application included with JFreeChart.  To run
it you need the two files jfreechart-0.9.0.jar and jcommon-0.6.2.jar.
Using JDK 1.3 (or later) you can start the demo by running the class:

    com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo.

For example, on Linux, the following command line will run the demo
application:

java -classpath jcommon-0.6.2.jar:jfreechart-0.9.0.jar com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo

Depending on your system configuration and the current working
directory, you may need to specify paths in the above command line.  

If you are using Windows, please note that the entries on the class
path should be separated with a semi-colon rather than a colon.

There are now several other demonstration applications included in the
download:

com.jrefinery.chart.demo.AreaChartDemo
com.jrefinery.chart.demo.DynamicDataDemo
com.jrefinery.chart.demo.LineChartDemo1
com.jrefinery.chart.demo.LineChartDemo2
com.jrefinery.chart.demo.MeterPlotTest
com.jrefinery.chart.demo.OverlaidPlotDemo
com.jrefinery.chart.demo.PriceVolumeDemo
com.jrefinery.chart.demo.SymbolicXYPlotDemo
com.jrefinery.chart.demo.SymbolicYPlotDemo

You can run these applications in the same way as the JFreeChartDemo
class described above.

6.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

0.9.0 : (7-Jun-2002) New plots including an area chart, a horizontal
        3D bar chart, a Gantt chart and a thermometer chart.
        Combination plots have been reworked to provide a
        simpler framework, and extends to allow category plots to be
        combined. There is now a facility to add a ChartMouseListener
        to the ChartPanel (formerly JFreeChartPanel).  An interactive
        zooming feature (experimental at this point) is now available
        for XYPlots.  A new Polish translation has been added. Several
        fixes have been applied to the default tool tip generators.  A
        workaround has been added to fix the alignment between time
        series charts and the date axis.  There are some improvements
        to the VerticalLogarithmicAxis class, and now a corresponding
        HorizontalLogarithmicAxis class.  Additional demonstration
        applications have been added.  Fixed the popup menu bug.

0.8.1 : (5-Apr-2002) Localised resource bundles for French, German and
        Spanish languages (thanks to Anthony Boulestreau, Thomas Meier
        and Hans-Jurgen Greiner for the translations).  An area XY
        plot and meter chart contributed by Hari.  Symbol charts
        contributed by Anthony Boulestreau. An improved
        CandleStickRenderer class from Sylvain Vieujot.  Updated
        servlet code from Bryan Scott.  XYItemRenderers now have a
        change listener mechanism and therefore do not have to be
        immutable.  Additional demonstration applications for
        individual chart types. Minor bug fixes. 

0.8.0 : (22-Mar-2002) All the category plots are now controlled
        through the one class (CategoryPlot) with plug-in renderers.
        Added a ResourceBundle for user interface items that require
        localisation. Added a logarithmic axis class contributed by
        Mike Duffy and some new JDBC and servlet code contributed by
        Bryan Scott.  Updated the JCommon class library to improve
        handling of time periods in different time zones.

0.7.4 : (6-Mar-2002) Bug fixes in the JCommon Class Library. Various
        Javadoc comment updates.  Some minor changes to the
        code. Added new domain name (http://www.object-refinery.com) 
        in the source headers.

0.7.3 : (14-Feb-2002) Bug fixes.

0.7.2 : (8-Feb-2002) Integrated the WindPlot code from Achilleus
        Mantzios. Added an optional background image for the
        JFreeChart class, and another optional background image for
        the Plot class.  Added alpha-transparency for the plot
        foreground and background.  Added new pie chart label types
        that show values.  Fixed a bug with the legend that results in
        a loop at small chart sizes. Added some tooltip methods that
        were missing from the previous version. Changed the Insets
        class on chart titles to a new Spacer class that will allow
        for relative or absolute insets (the plan is to eventually
        replace all Insets in the JFreeChart classes).  Fixed a bug in
        the setAutoRangeIncludesZero method of the NumberAxis class.
        Added the instructions that were missing from the copies of
        the GNU Lesser General Public Licence included with JFreeChart.

0.7.1 : (25-Jan-2002) Added tooltips, crosshairs and zooming
        functions, thanks to Jonathan Nash and Hans-Jurgen Greiner
        for contributing the code that these features are based on.
        Moved the combination charts into the package
        com.jrefinery.chart.combination, made a number of other small
        API changes and fixed some bugs.  Removed the Javadoc HTML
        from the download to save space (you can regenerate it from
        the source code if you need it).

0.7.0 : (11-Dec-2001) New combination plots developed by Bill
        Kelemen.  Added Wolfgang Irler's servlet demo to the standard
        download.  The About window in the demo application now
        includes a list of developers that have contributed to the
        project.

0.6.0 : (27-Nov-2001) New plots including scatter plot, stacked bar
        charts and 3D bar charts.  Improved pie chart.  Data
        interfaces and classes moved to the JCommon class library.
        New properties to control spacing on bar charts.  New
        auto-tick mechanism.  JFreeChartPanel now incorporates
        buffering, and popup menu.  Javadocs revised.  Fixed numerous
        bugs from version 0.5.6.  Demo application updated.
