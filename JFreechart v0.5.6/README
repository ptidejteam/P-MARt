JFREECHART version 0.5.6 (25 November 2000)
===========================================

1. INTRODUCTION
JFreeChart is an open-source Java class library for producing charts.  It runs on the Java 2 Platform (SDK1.2.2 or later) and uses the Java 2D API for drawing.

2. LICENCE
JFreeChart has been made available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL).  Please read the licence and make sure that you are prepared to comply with its terms (if not, you should not use JFreeChart in your own applications).  

Note that the LGPL is a complicated licence - try reading and understanding the much simpler GNU General Public Licence (GPL) first.  If the GPL is all that you require, then note that the LGPL allows you to apply the terms of the GPL to JFreeChart.

3. NO LICENCE FEES AND NO WARRANTY
You do not have to pay a licence fee to use JFreeChart, but please note that the author distributes the software WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Please refer refer to the licence for details.

4. RUNNING THE DEMO APPLICATION
The demo application is now included in the jfreechart.jar file, so you no longer need demo.jar (so you won't find it in the download).  Using SDK 1.2.2 (or later) you can start the demo by invoking the class com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo.

For example, the following command line will run the demo application:

java -cp jfreechart.jar com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo

Depending on your system configuration and the current working directory, you may need to specify paths in the above command line, as noted below:

{**PATH**}java -cp {**PATH**}jfreechart.jar com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo
