/**
 * An exception which DrJava throws on an unexpected error.
 * Many times, we have to catch BadLocationExceptions in
 * code that accesses DefinitionDocument, even if we know for a
 * fact that a BadLocationException cannot occur.  In that case,
 * and in other similar cases where we know that an exception should not
 * occur, we throw this on the off chance that something does go wrong.
 * This aids us in debugging the code.
