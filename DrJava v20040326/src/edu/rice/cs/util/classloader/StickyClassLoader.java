/**
 * A {@link ClassLoader} that works as the union of two classloaders, but
 * always tries to delegate to the first of these.
 *
 * The purpose for this class is to ensure that classes loaded transitively
 * due to some class's loading are also loaded with the right classloader.
 * Here's the problem: Say that class A contains a reference to class B,
 * but the specific B is unknown to clients of class A.
 * Class A is loadable by the standard classloader, but class B needs
 * to be loaded with a (known) custom classloader.
 * <P>
 *
 * If A were loaded using
 * the standard classloader, it would fail because this would cause the
 * transitive loading of B to be done by the system loader as well.
 * If A were loaded with the custom loader, the same thing would happen --
 * the custom loader would delegate to the system loader to load A (since
 * it doesn't load non-custom-loader-requiring classes), but this would
 * associate class A with the system classloader. (Every class is associated
 * with the loader that called {@link ClassLoader#defineClass} to define it
 * in the JVM.) This association would make B be loaded by the standard loader!
 * <P>
 *
 * To get around this problem, we use this class, which acts mostly
 * as a union of two classloaders. The trick, however, is that the
 * StickyClassLoader has itself associated with all classes it loads, even
 * though the actual work is done by the two loaders it delegate to.
 * (It does this by calling {@link ClassLoader#findResource} on the
 * subordinate loaders to get the class data, but then by calling
 * {@link ClassLoader#defineClass} itself to preserve the association.
