  /**
   * Creates a new DefinitionsDocument.
   * This used to be named createDefaultDocument() so that the view
   * (DefinitionsPane) would create a DefinitionsDocument by default
   * when it was constructed.  However, we already have an existing
   * DefinitionsDocument we want to use when the DefinitionsPane is
   * constructed, so this default one was being created and thrown
   * away (very expensive).  Ideally, we would have the DefinitionsPane
   * use our existing document from the beginning, but the JEditorPane
   * constructor does not take in a Document.  The only possible
   * approach would be to have this EditorKit return the desired 
   * existing document when the JEditorPane requests a new one, but
   * since the EditorKit must be kept as a static field on DefinitionsPane
   * (since we can't set one until after JEditorPane's constructor is
   * finished), there's no clean way to tell the EditorKit which document
   * to return at which time.  (It would require a large synchronization
   * effort each time a DefinitionsPane is constructed.)
   * 
   * As an easier alternative, we just let the DefaultEditorKit return
   * a PlainDocument (much lighter weight), which can then be thrown
   * away when the true DefinitionsDocument is assigned.
   * 
   * Improvements to this approach are welcome...  :)
