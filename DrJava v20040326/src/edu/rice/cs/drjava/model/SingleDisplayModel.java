/**
 * A GlobalModel that enforces invariants associated with having
 * one active document at a time.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * <OL>
 * <LI>{@link #getDefinitionsDocuments} will always return an array of
 *     at least size 1.
 * </LI>
 * <LI>(follows from previous) If there is ever no document in the model,
 *     a new one will be created.
 * </LI>
 * <LI>There is always exactly one active document, which can be get/set
 *     via {@link #getActiveDocument} and {@link #setActiveDocument}.
 * </LI>
 * </OL>
 *
 * Other functions added by this class:
 * <OL>
 * <LI>When calling {@link #openFile}, if there is currently only one open
 *     document, and it is untitled and unchanged, it will be closed after the
 *     new document is opened. This means that, in one atomic transaction, the
 *     model goes from having one totally empty document open to having one
 *     document (the requested one) open.
 * </LI>
 * </OL>
