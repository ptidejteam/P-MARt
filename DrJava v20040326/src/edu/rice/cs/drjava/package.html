  This is the top-level package for DrJava.
  It contains {@link DrJava} as an entry point to the program and
  {@link IndentFiles}  as a command-line interface to the indenting 
  algorithm.
  <p>
  It also contains bookkeeping classes, such as {@link Version}, which 
  holds the version number information, and {@link CodeStatus}, which
  indicates whether the current build is Stable or Development.  These
  classes are automatically generated by the build process and should
  not be manually modified.
