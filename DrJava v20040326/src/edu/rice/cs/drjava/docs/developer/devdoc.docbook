    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>By releasing DrJava as an open source project, our team welcomes anyone to download, modify, and use the source code for their own benefit.  We hope that this outreach to the development community can continue to help DrJava achieve its educational goals and improve its quality as a stable and full-featured development environment.  This documentation will help you get started with downloading and compiling the DrJava code base.</para>

    <para>To ensure that DrJava's reliability and robustness is maintained, the DrJava development team adheres to several guidelines and philosophies when making changes.  We will soon add chapters to this documentation describing these design philosophies and coding conventions, in an effort to help DrJava developers keep the quality of the project high.</para>

  <chapter id="environment">
    <title>Setting Up A Build Environment</title>
    <para>This chapter walks you through setting up your build environment to develop DrJava.  It is addressed to both independent developers and members of the DrJava development team who will be committing code to the CVS repository.  We attempt to support development on Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows.</para>

    <section id="env-sf-account">
      <title>SourceForge Account</title>
      <para>Regardless of whether you will be committing code or not, we recommend registering for a SourceForge user account to check out code and submit or respond to bugs and feature requests.  If you will be a member of the DrJava development team, the DrJava project administrators will add your account to the project to allow you to commit code and perform related tasks.  If you already have a SourceForge account, you can skip the first two steps.</para>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Java Software Development Kit</title>
            <para>If you don't have it already, you will need to install Sun's Java SDK (not just the JRE).  If you are using Linux or Windows, install version 1.4.1 or later.  If you are using Mac OS X 10.2 or higher, you should already have version 1.4.1 installed.  (Earlier versions of Mac OS X have JDK 1.3.1.)  You can download the SDK for your platform from <ulink url="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</ulink>.</para>
          </formalpara>
          <para>Note: If you wish for your builds of DrJava to be compatible with JDK 1.3.1, you must compile with JDK 1.3.1.</para>

      <title>SourceForge SSH Key Pairs</title>
      <para>If you will developing frequently from the same computer or on a Windows platform, we recommend setting up a SSH key pair to allow you to check out and commit code without having to enter your SourceForge password every time.  (This is required to commit code in a Windows environment due to a complication with Cygwin.)  However, you should not set up a key pair on a public Windows computer-- only on your personal computer, or on a personal account on a Unix server.  Follow the directions below to set up a key pair.</para>

  <!-- Chapter: General Overview -->



  <!-- Chapter: Using Ant -->
  <chapter id="ant">
    <title>Using Ant with DrJava</title>
    <para>We use an Ant build script to handle all compilation and code repository tasks for DrJava.  It is important that you use Ant rather than Javac and CVS directly, both because we use a specialized compiler (JSR-14) and because we <emphasis>require</emphasis> that all the tests pass before any commit.  Our Ant build script allows us to enforce this, while also simplifying the process of compiling and committing.</para>

    <section id="ant-common">
      <title>Commonly Used Ant Tasks</title>
      <para>This section lists several of the Ant tasks you will frequently use while developing DrJava.  You can run these tasks in either the <filename>src/edu/rice/cs/util</filename> or <filename>src/edu/rice/cs/drjava</filename> directories by typing <literal>ant</literal> and then the task name.  For example, to run the <literal>clean compile</literal> task for the <literal>util</literal> package, type the following:</para>

      <programlisting>
cd ~/drjava/src/edu/rice/cs/util
ant clean compile
      </programlisting>

      <para>Note that you can list as many task names at once as you like.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <formalpara>
            <title>Updating from CVS: "<literal>update</literal>"</title>
            <para>This will update the current package with all of the changes that have been made in the CVS repository.  It is important to run this frequently to be sure your code is not out of date.  Note that this will be run automatically when you commit code to ensure your copy is not outdated.</para>
          </formalpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <formalpara>
            <title>Compiling: "<literal>clean compile</literal>"</title>
            <para>This will compile all the classes in the current package.  The <literal>clean</literal> task first deletes all existing class files from the <filename>built</filename> directory, and can be run on its own.  Unfortunately, if you are using a version of JSR-14 prior to 2.2, it is required to use <literal>clean</literal> every time you compile DrJava, because the use of generics prevents the compiler from knowing which specific class files need to be recompiled.  Thus, if you run the <literal>compile</literal> target on its own, you will probably get compile errors.</para>
          </formalpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <formalpara>
            <title>Testing the code: "<literal>test</literal>"</title>
            <para>This will run all of the unit tests in the current package.  Specifically, this looks for all JUnit tests in classes with names that end in <literal>Test</literal>, compiling classes if necessary.  This can be a very time consuming task (ie. over 15 minutes on slower computers).  Note that this task is run automatically when you commit code to ensure that nothing breaks.  As a side note, <literal>test</literal> is the default Ant task for DrJava, so running Ant with no arguments will invoke this task.</para>

This is because Swing components will be created in the tests, which require an X server even if they are not explicitly shown.</para>

          <para>Since running all the tests can take a very long time, there is an option to run only those tests which match a certain regular expression.  When running Ant, specify a <literal>-Dtest-spec</literal> argument with the regular expression matching the tests you want to run, <emphasis>not including the word <literal>Test</literal></emphasis>.  For example, to run only the GlobalModelCompileTest, use the following command.</para>

This task incorporates most of the other tasks:  it updates your code to ensure it is not out of date, it compiles your code, and it runs all the unit tests.  If these tasks pass, it will ask for a commit message and commit the code.  (You can either type the message manually on one line, or specify the name of a file containing the message, if you want to have multiple lines.)  If you have not set up an SSH key pair (see <link linkend="env-sf-keypair">Sourceforge SSH Key Pairs</link>), you will have to enter your Sourceforge password several times.

Run "<literal>cvs add [FILE]</literal>" for each new file that you will be adding before running <literal>ant commit</literal>.  Also, it is very important that you copy the license comment from another file into your new file.  We also prefer that you include a "<literal>@version &#36;Id&#36;</literal>" tag in your class-level Javadoc comment, which helps us note the last time the file was modified.</para>

  <!-- Chapter: Updating the docs -->
  <chapter id="documentation">
    <title>Updating the Documentation</title>
    <para>The DrJava User and Developer Documentation files are written in DocBook, a form of XML.  It is important to keep these files up to date for both the user help documentation and instructions to help developers get started.</para>
      
    <section id="doc-files">
      <title>Documentation Files</title>
      <para>The user and developer DocBook files are named <filename>userdoc.docbook</filename> and <filename>devdoc.docbook</filename>, respectively, and they are located in the <filename>src/edu/rice/cs/drjava/docs/</filename> directory.  Emacs and modern versions of KDE's KWrite are both good editors for DocBook files.  Please try to maintain a consistent style within the documentation, both in tone (eg. somewhat informal-- "you" instead of "the user") and formatting (eg. literal tags for small bits of code, paragraphs on one line, etc).</para>

      <title>Building the Documentation</title>
      <para>There are Ant build targets for creating HTML and PDF versions of the user and developer documentation.  To use these targets, you must have <filename>docbook2html</filename> (and optionally <filename>docbook2pdf</filename>) installed and on your path.  Beware that some versions of these tools may not work with our build script or may generate HTML files without an <filename>index.html</filename> file.  (If this is the case, as it is currently on the greenland server, you'll probably want to copy <filename>book1.html</filename> to <filename>index.html</filename>.  Don't just rename it, because other files will link to the old one.)</para>
      
      <formalpara>
        <title>Ant Targets</title>
        <para>You can build HTML files for both user and developer documentation at once with <literal>ant docs</literal>, which places the HTML in <filename>built/edu/rice/cs/drjava/docs/</filename>.  The two sets can be built independently with <literal>ant userdocs</literal> and <literal>ant devdocs</literal>.  You can calso build a PDF file for the user documentation with <literal>ant userdocs-pdf</literal>.  (There is currently no target for a developer documentation PDF, though it would not be difficult to add.)</para>

        <title>Updating the Website</title>
        <para>It is important to update the DrJava website after all changes to the documentation.  This involves copying the HTML files for the user and developer documentation (and the PDF file for the user documentation) to <filename>drjava.sf.net:/home/groups/d/dr/drjava/htdocs/</filename>.  The HTML files should go in the <filename>userdocs/</filename> and <filename>devdocs/</filename> directories, respectively, while the PDF should be saved as <filename>drjava-userdoc.pdf</filename> directly in <filename>htdocs/</filename>.</para>

        <para>The documentation is committed automatically with any <literal>ant commit</literal>, but it is hardly necessary to run the full suite of unit tests for a change that does not affect the codebase.  Instead, the documentation can be committed in isolation with <literal>ant commit-docs</literal>.</para>

            <title>Use of the Configuration Framework</title>
            <para>DrJava's configurable options are managed through a framework in the <literal>edu.rice.cs.drjava.config</literal> package.  This framework takes care of loading and saving options from the <filename>.drjava</filename> file, as well as managing listeners to changed configuration options.  The main class of interest is <literal>OptionConstants</literal>, which defines all options and their default values.  You can get and change settings using the static <literal>DrJava.getConfig()</literal> method.</para>
          </formalpara>
          <para>It is very important never to use the configuration framework in the Interpreter JVM, since this will instantiate a new copy of the framework inconsistent with the one in the Main JVM.  (It also causes the "SlaveJVMRunner" icon to appear in Mac OS X.)  It is also very important never to use the configuration framework in the Eclipse plug-in, because it causes Eclipse to crash.  (We're not sure why, but it's better for us to use Eclipse's preferences in that world anyway.)</para>
