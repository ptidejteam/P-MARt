   * Determines if the previous line in the document starts a block comment.
   * We know that the current line is in a block comment. Therefore, if the
   * start of the previous line is not inside of a block comment, then the
   * previous line must have started the comment. 
   * <p>
   * There is an exception to this; however, it is handled adequately. Consider
   * the case when the previous line contains the following code:
   * <code>*&#47; bar(); &#47;*</code>
   * <p>
   * Our approach will say that since the beginning of the previous line is
   * inside of a comment, the previous line did not start the comment. This
   * is acceptable because we think of the previous line as a continuation
   * of a larger commented out region.
