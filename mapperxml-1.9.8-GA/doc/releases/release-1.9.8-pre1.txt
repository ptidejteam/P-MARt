Quick Highlights

Important Changes
================================================================

New Features:
================================================================
o	Form now has built in DocumentBuilder. Simply set the documentURI
	property and when Form.initForm() is invoked, Document will be
	parsed.
	
	There are currently 3 builders for Documents:
		TidyDocumentAdapterBuilder
		XercesDocumentAdapterBuilder
		JAXPDocumentAdapterBuilder
	DocumentAdapterBuilderFactory will try to determine appropriate 
	builder in the following order:
		System property: com.taursys.dom.DocumentAdapterBuilderFactory
			set to desired DocumentAdapterBuilderFactory.
		If class org.w3c.tidy.Tidy can be found, uses 
			TidyDocumentAdapterBuilderFactory
		If class org.apache.xerces.parsers.DOMParser can be found, uses
			XercesDocumentAdapterBuilderFactory
		If class javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder can be found, uses
			JAXPDocumentAdapterBuilderFactory
		else throws DocumentAdapterBuilderException
	If you do not want to use built in behavior, do not set the
	documentURI property, or override Form.initForm() method.

o	Created new Attribute component which is now integral to all Element 
	type components. Created new Element interface which is implemented by 
	all DOM type peer components (formerly DocumentComponents).
	Attributes can be easily created and added to Elements. They can also
	be bound to the Element's ValueHolder.

o CodeGen tool now accepts project file name as argument at startup
	
Public API Interface Changes/Deprecations:
================================================================
o	Form.setDocument method now throws DocumentAdapterBuilderException
o Added removeAttribute method to DocumentAdapter interface

Internal API Interface Changes/Deprecations:
================================================================
o	Removed deprecated dispatchers and related calls
o	Form(ServletForm) should detect which DOM version is in
	class loader and use appropriate DocumentAdaptor.

Bux Fixes:
================================================================
o	Issue with custom components when used in multi-row input.
	Dispatchers in children of custom component were using their
	own index instead of the grand-parent template's dispatcher
	which was iterating the index. This resulted in the children
	always retrieving the first value of multi-row input.
	SOLUTION: Refactored Dispatchers and DispatchingContiners
	to add notion of parentDispatcher.
o Fixed problem in component factory. When initForm is called 
	more than once for a SubForm, it wipes out functionality. 
	Normally, initForm should only be called once, but multiple
	calls should not cause problems.
	SOLUTION: Fixed bug in ComponentFactory when moving existing
	components, tried to remove existing component from
	rootContainer instead of actual parent container.
o Problem in HTMLComponentFactory - problem when nesting multiple
  level templates (ie parent-child-grandchild). Structure
  became corrupt.
	SOLUTION: Fixed bug in ComponentFactory when moving existing
	components, tried to remove existing component from
	rootContainer instead of actual parent container.
o Problem in HTMLComponentFactory. It was creating and binding
  components with well formed id's (but without a value holder
  with a matching alias) to the last value holder in the given
  array.
o HTMLComponentFactory is sometimes creating components as 
  Template if they are nested in a Template. This was caused
  by ComponentFactory.getSuggestedComponents altering the
  original suggestion list for a tag, rather than altering
  a working copy of the suggestion list. For example, once
  a span tag had an id containing TEMPLATE_NODE, subsequent
  span tags all had Template.class as their top suggestion.



Other Changes:
================================================================
o	Added toString methods of components to provide	diagnostic 
	information for: ValueHolders, Models, XML Components,
	HTML Components.
o	Cleanup imports
o Added more HTML tags the HTMLComponent factory. Default components
	defined for all HTML 4.01 tags. See javadoc for
	com.taursys.html.HTMLComponentFactory for a full list of
	defined tags. Any tags not in the list will default to a
	com.taursys.xml.DocumentElement.
o	Refactored DOM_2_20001113_DocumentAdapter to extend
	DOM_1_20000929_DocumentAdapter.
