Version 1.9.4
Release Notes:

Quick Highlights
================================================================
o   Added new Responder subcomponent to ServletForm to customize
    response during runtime.
o   Added new properties to control ServletForm behavior.
o   Added new Components: CheckboxField and HTMLCheckbox.
o   Added default value to Parameters, Fields and Triggers.
    This allows controls to respond to case where data is NOT
    present in request.

Important Changes
================================================================
none

Public API Interface Changes/Deprecations:
================================================================
o   The xmlWriter (AbstractWriter) property of the ServletForm
    has been deprecated.  The writer is now an optional
    subcomponent of a DocumentAdapter (if needed by the specific
    DocumentAdapter).  These was deprecated to support the new
    Responder subcomponent.

Internal API Interface Changes/Deprecations:
================================================================
o   The DocumentAdapter has two new methods defined:
    write(OutputStream) and write(Writer).  These were added to
    support the new Responder subcomponent.

Bux Fixes:
================================================================
none

New Features:
================================================================
o   A new Responder subcomponent has been added to the ServletForm.
    Implementations of this subcomponent will provide an easy way
    to change the response behavior of a ServletForm during runtime.
    There are a number of implementations of the Responder subcomponent:
        HTMLResponder - renders and sends HTML Document as response (default)
        ClientRedirectResponder -  redirects the client to a URL as the response.
        ErrorResponder - sends status code and optional message as response.
        NoResponseResponder - responds by doing nothing.
        StreamResponder - responds by sending its input stream to the
            response output stream.
o   Added new properties to control ServletForm behavior.  The
    enableInput flag indicates whether or not to process input.
    If this flag is set, the run method will invoke the
    dispatchInput method to process input parameters for
    components. Disable input if you are processing a request
    where no input parameters are expected. This will avoid any
    input being set by default values (or behavior of HTMLCheckbox).
        The enableActions flag indicates whether or not to
    process actions. If this flag is set, the run method will
    invoke the dispatchActions method to process action
    parameters for trigger components.  Disable actions if you
    are processing a request where no action parameters are
    expected.  This will avoid any actions being triggered
    by default values.
o   Added new Components CheckboxField and HTMLCheckbox.  The
    CheckboxField is a two state control: selected/unselected.
    You can define the values to be associated with each state.
    The HTMLCheckbox includes special behavior to cope with the
    fact that only the checked(selected) state is transmitted
    in the request - the unchecked(unselected) state is not
    transmitted and therefore must be assumed.
o   Added default behavior to Parameter component (inherited by
    all subclasses including Fields).  A new property defaultValue
    has been added.  If this property is set (not null), and the
    expected parameter is NOT in the request, then the component
    will behave as if the defaultValue was received in the request.
o   Added default behavior to Trigger component (inherited by
    all subclasses including Button).  A new property defaultTrigger
    has been added.  If this property is true, and the expected
    parameter is NOT in the request, then the component will
    behave as if its text value was received in the request and
    will fire.

Other Changes:
================================================================
o   Changed initializer for text property of Trigger.  Was
    initialized as blank String, now is null.
