MapperXML
Version 1.9.5
Release Notes:

Quick Highlights
================================================================
o   Added support for multipart requests. Supports file uploads.
o   Minor bug fixes.

New Features:
================================================================
o   Added support for multipart requests. This supports file
    uploads within forms using input type=file.
    The ServletForm also supports multipart type requests. A
    multipart request is sent by the browser when form data contains
    1 or more uploaded files. To support this feature, if the
    incoming request has a content type of "multipart/form-data",
    the request is wrapped in another request object which is
    capable of processing multipart requests. The wrapper request is
    created via the createRequestWrapper method which you can override.
    By default, that method returns a HttpMultiPartServletRequest object.
o   You can now set the default Date format used to parse/format
    Dates. This will affect ALL default date formating within the
    application. The format is set in the com.taursys.DataTypes
    class using the static method setDefaultDateFormat.
o   ModelParseException - the UserFriendlyMessage property is
    now being set. (see Mapper Examples: FormatPage).

Other Changes:
================================================================
o   Updated javadoc for SelectModel, DefaultSelectModel,
    SelectField and HTMLSelect.

Bux Fixes:
================================================================
o   Null pointer exception if "id" is null when rendering any
    DocumentComponent type component. Now a Debug warning will
    be issued to the log.
o   Button is broken - Trigger works but not button. Does not
    generate action event. Modified lazyAddNotify and
    lazyRemoveNotify to register as listener for both Trigger
    and Render event notification.
o   Default Trigger not firing when its text property is null.
    Modified to support null text property.
o   Template renderer is adding "__row#" to nodes who did not
    even originally have an ID. DOM method node.getAttribute("id")
    is not returning null when attribute is not present. It
    is returning an empty String. Changed test to "not null and
    not empty".
o   Problem with default date format when parsing.  Output display
    is YYYY-MM-DD but unable to parse without setting format.
    Modified all models to use new method in DataTypes to format
    rather than using the toString methods.
o   NumberFormatException is not being caught.  Now DefaultTextModel
    will catch NumberFormatException and process like a
    ParseException.  Both these are wrapped in a ModelParseException.

Known Limitations/Problems/Bugs:
================================================================
o   Sometimes, HttpMultiPartServletRequest appears to append a
    carridge return onto end of binary file (015 octal). Not sure
    if this is a parsing problem or a browser problem.
