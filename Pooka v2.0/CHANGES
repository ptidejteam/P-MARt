--------------------

opening a message by keypress was incorrectly happening on the AwtEventThread.

fixed up error display messages.

removed ability to connect to self-signed SSL providers due to incompatibility
with WebStart.  this may be restored in the future.

folder tables now save their width settings.

sending a message now sets the new message window to disable until the
send is completed.

060227 release
--------------

in the folder file chooser, double-clicking on a folder that holds only
messages (no other folders) now selects the folder, rather than opening it.

fixed a bug with subscribing to subfolders of stores where the subfolder 
would get the subscription, but the sub-subfolder wouldn't.

you can now subscribe to multiple folders at once.

added a new icon set, and added in an IconManager to allow for changeable
icon sets.  set IconManager._default=IconSet.crystalclear to see the new
icon set.  this will most likely be the default iconset for release 2.0

fixed a javamail-crypto bug in which missing classes can cause 
getEncryptionUtils() to throw an uncaught error.

messages from sent folders should show up properly in search folders now.

server returns a bogus unread count.

changed the default font under windows to something a bit more readable.

if autoCache is set, you now connect to the folder and show the messages
before you start to download the messages to cache them.

added a way to save all the attachments on a message at once.

C+W now closes internal frame windows.

if you have multiple folder windows opeening on startup, only the first
one is selected by default now, so that you don't have your keyboard focus
changing on you.

middle clicking folder and message internalframes now deselects them
and moves them to the back.

--------------

messages.

made status area at bottom smaller.

added a system tray icon for Pooka (currenly disabled by default; still
experimental).

050505 release
--------------

added -open and --from options to startup.  this allows you to invoke Pooka 
to only send a new message, rather than starting up the entire client.

added a network listener so that, by default, if you try to start up two
Pooka clients from the same Pookarc you instead will just bring the first
one to the foreground.  this also allows an external invocation to contact
a running client to have it open a new message.

trying to sort a MessageTable before all the messages are loaded no longer
results in a gui hang.

we now show a status while closing stores on exit.

fixed a bug where replying to a message in a detached window could result
in the wrong profile being selected by default.

changed the order of saves so that if the save to sent folder fails for
a new message, the message window doesn't disappear until after the

--------------

optimized large deletes of messages on imap so it doesn't poll the store
for each message removed.

fixed a bug where offline changes might not get caught after reconnection
to imap store.

fixed OutOfMemoryError when trying to subscribe to folders in jdk 1.5.

fixed focus with jdk1.5 and closing internal frames bug.

to a higher priority.

button.

fixed AttachmentPane.openAction from showing dialog on store thread instead
of AWTEventThread.  Also changed the file chooser on the Attachment save
dialog to be on the AWTEventThread.

made it so the FolderTracker's actions run at a lower priority.  also fixed
the tracking function so that it calculates the next update time after the
first one has finished, rather than before.

fixed a display bug in which a line that was the exact length of the display
field then followed by a newline would add in an extra, unnecessary newline.

as having changed.

the ui.

fixed a NPE if you bounce a message.

stack trace.

upgraded to JavaMail 1.3.2.

added some support for jdk 1.4 logging framework, including a way to
configure more granulated log settings.

changed NewAccountPooka so that you can accept server values that the
machine can't connect to at the moment.

--------------

added limited support for drag and drop.

added a way to specify caching scheme per folder, so we can avoid autocaching
of messages in spam and/or sent folders.

added a splashscreen on startup.

optimized the loading of new messages a bit so that we only do one fetch.

messages without CC or BCC entries no longer send a blank cc or bcc line
in the headers.

lots of new messages.

fixed expunging on backend filteres.

changed the Cached search so that you can now make a custom display filter
for cached and uncached messages.

fixed a NPE in deleting multiple messages from a search window.

changed the theme selection menu so that we should see all of (and only) the
available look and feels.

040615 release
--------------
disconnection events now test the entire store to see if the connection
has gone down.

left and right arrows on read message pane now just scrolls left and right.

fixed FilterEditor so that the correct filter is shown. 

messages are now only saved to the sent folder after the send succeeds.

fixed DeleteFilter so it doesn't throw an error on configuration.

fixed forward with attachments so that it no longer tries to treat the 
first attachment as the content of the message.

smtp authentication no longer requires you to enter a password every time.

applying folder filters to a set of messages now shows a status dialog.

unsuccessful open attachment commands now show an error.

(shift-rightclick), or open with (control-rightclick) the attachment.

optimized loading/displaying of new messages in disconnected imap mode.

fixed opening attachments from preview panel.

running with maildir support (including POP3 with a maildir backend), you
no longer get excess ...subFolder directories on WinXP.

made a way to reconnect to a folder after it's been disconnected, other than
closing and reopening the entire store.

fixed a bug where deleted messages weren't being removed from the folder table
after reconnecting under disconnected imap.

fixed a bug in which, when switching from desktop mode to preview mode
with autopreview off, you could end up opening a new window with the enter 
key instead of just showing the message in the preview pane.

fixed a minor bug in which clearing a preview-pane mode message with a 
custom theme would result in the message flashing for a moment with a 
default font.

fixed a bug where, in preview pane mode, messages with attachments wouldn't
get their themes set correctly.

made it so selecting or scrolling in a messagepanel will remove the
new message icon.

fixed a bug in configuration where a new user without an explicit SMTP
server set would end up causing NPE's when it tried to send a message.

optimized IMAP folder loading so that we initially fetch the SEEN flag,
and then pre-fetch the messages we'll actually display (by loading around
the getFirstUnreadMessage() value)

fixed editor display of boolean properties in Folder editor.

worked around a sun bug in jdk1.4 which would result in the 
FolderSelectorPane being empty the first time it was brought up.

added Bounce Message command, plus a BounceMessage filter.

modified the sendMessageList of the NewMessageInfo to use a sendMessageMap
instead.

folders.  this also fixes an exception you could get when trying to edit
filters while disconnected from an IMAP server.

--------------

added support for S/MIME and OpenPGP encryption.

fixed a bug in which the new message notification didn't appear immediately
on the FolderNode.

fixed a case where hitting 'send' twice could end up sending two copies
of the message.

moved much of the send message code from the AWTEventThread to the 
OutgoingMailServer thread.

up and down arrows on ReadMessageWindows now scroll the ScrollPane.  

fixed the handling of incorrectly-formed multipart/alternative messages so 
that we display the content.

a default UserProfile set, we use the default instead of returning null.

the next column.

changed the display for some error message so that there's acutally a 
space between the message and the error code.

IMAP/SSL.

would lead to a NullPointerException.

modified the loading of table display infos so that we now don't fail

work.

modified the MessageProxy class so that we don't create lots and lots of
unnecessary actions.

fixed a couple of memory leaks

for internal frames, focus now goes to the correct component instead of to
the toolbar.

030329 release
--------------

folder windows now remember both their last location and their last size

we were seeing while switching to disconnected mode.

would cause a NPE the next time a folder was selected.

Added a way to delete a folder.

Pooka now remembers its location on screen when restarting.

fixed a problem in Preview mode in which the folder toolbar wouldn't get
activated on startup.

optimized the caching system somewhat so that we're not writing files over
and over agian to the filesystem.  this may also fix a problem where a
message could be cached as blank if the connection to the store broke at
just the right time.

attachment file choosers now remember your last directory, instead of always
starting in your home directory.

messages in Sent folders are no longer shown as new.

JDK.

add a find in page feature for Read Messages.

fixed a problem with the focus not always returning to the correct component.

030115 release
--------------

fixed lots of other problems in jdk 1.4, including incorrect sizing of some
of the configuration dialogs, some times when focus wouldn't follow back from
a deleted message, and....  some other stuff.  don't remember it all.

fixed SSL on jdk 1.4

----- branched for 1.1/2.0 release. -----

fixed a bug where part of the error message was getting shown twice.

made it so the INBOX is required for imap servers.  with luck this will work
around a problem in which the inbox sometimes doesn't show up for imap 
stores.

fixed a bug where the copy button on messages wasn't getting enabled.

made it so imap connections time out more quickly.

fixed the build information so that we now include the kunststoff files.

modified the toolbars and the images some.

streams.

fixed a NPE that could happen if you tried to delete a message that was in
the process of getting deleted.

020918 release
--------------

removed a lot of unused image files.  this should make the download at least
a bit smaller.

fixed the AddressBookEditor so that newly created AddressBooks are 
editable.  you still have to hit 'apply' first to create the address book,
though.

made it so the outbox and sent folder are both properly configured when
you start up the first time.  otherwise, though, they still require a 
restart for changes to be made.  this fix only applies to the first time
you start.

added a default domain setting, so that if you enter in an email address 
without a domain, then the default domain is appended.  if no default domain
is set, then the domain of the user is appended.

fixed an error where incomplete matches to address book entries would return
as if they were complete matches.

made it so the address entry windows actually show up in desktop mode.

bringing up folders in disconnected mode shows the correct number of
read and unread messages again.

formatted header.

the address book.

added a button for actually using the address list to pull in addresses
to the to:, cc:, and bcc: fields.

items in a sent folder.

fixed a possible deadlock in manipulating messages that are the results
of a search.

added a search in progress dialog so that you can see that something's
happening while waiting for search results.

added an attachment icon to the main folder/message table.

020810 release
--------------

NOTE:  i modified the local mail store (mbox) configuration a bit.  if you're
using any local mail folders, you may need to change the Mail Directory and
Inbox File settings.  your inbox is specified by Inbox File; subfolders are
stored in Mail Directory/folders.

pooka can now exit even if all the open stores aren't available.

made it so we don't do unnecessary redraws on the folder panel every time
a message changes or is loaded.

removed several excess communications with the mail store.

added a disconnected icon so that it looks different if you're browsing
messages in connected vs. disconnected imap.

added an icon for the root node in the folder tree.

updated the NewAccountPooka so that you can set a better variety of choices
during setup.

added ssl support for pop3 folders.

added Add buttons to many of the list choices in the configuration editors.
makes it a lot easier to add all of the items that you want in the correct
order.

made the VariableEditorPane change within the editor instead of 
popping up a new window.

made it so by default the ssl seeding is done with /dev/urandom instead of
using the very very slow seeding that SecureRandom uses.  this speeds
up initial ssl connections by a huge factor.

020703 release
--------------

fixed a bug which prevented you from deleting a message from a 
disconnected folder.

in preview pane mode, when you open up a folder, the keyboard focus now
shifts to the message table.

added a progress dialog to caching multiple messages during disconnected
operation.  

changed the sorting method on the message tables.  now clicking a column
a second time will reverse the sort on that column.  doing a shift+click
will still explicitly do a reverse sort.

added an option to preview pane mode in which we don't auto-preview
the selected message.  hitting space or enter now previews the messages.
also added an option not to automatically select the first unread message.
these options are useful for situations in which a person doesn't want a
new message read automatically on folder load.

added keybindings for lots of stuff, including searches, printing, selecting
the next unread message, etc.  added a page showing the keybindings, 
available through the help menu or by pressing Alt-K.

fixed the keybindings on top-level message frames.  those should work now.

selecting a NewMessageWindow now selects either the to: field, the subject:
field, or the text body, depending on which ones are filled out.

changed the display algorithm so that several messages are loaded
before the folder window itself is shown.

made it so exiting pooka before all the messages are loaded doesn't result
in a bunch of exceptions.

improved the startup time, so that open folders show up more quickly.

fixed the popup menu on the attachment pane so that it shows up in the
right place (and isn't selected by default when you right click and 
release).  fixed a similar problem with the nodes in the Folder Tree.

fixed the keybindings in preview pane mode.

020429 release
--------------

fixed a NPE that could happen when switching from preview pane mode to
desktop pane mode.

fixed some minor bugs involving detaching windows.

fixed the theme support so that the default theme is actually used for
just about everything.

fixed a bug where finding the first unread message was done on the 
awt event thread instead of the FolderThread.

fixed pooka so that the default image and text viewers that come with
javamail will actually work when you double click on an attachment.

preview pane mode now gives a resonable size for the message table.

nested subfolders were not being cached when in disconnected imap mode.

fixed a bug where responding or forwarding a message with a null subject
would result in a NullPointerException

fixed a bug where multiple messages could not be copied between folders

changed the load message tracker to synchronize on the folder thread.

fixed a problem where a second request for an invalid message would
result in an empty window.

fixed the status messages so that they should be cleared properly.

fixed disconnected imap autocaching. 

caching messages when using disconnected imap no longer marks the messages
as read.

made some implementation changes to the way that disconnected imap folders
are loaded.  this should result in a fairly substantial performace increase
for large folders.

moved saving emails to a sent folder from the AWTEvent thread to the 
appropriate FolderThread.

fixed the CachingFolderInfo to work with the new display system.

020322 release
--------------

made it so replying to or forwarding messages with only html content results
in the inclusion of the html code.  best i can do for now.

fixed a bug in the search window display in which read messages were included
in the unread message count.

switched the popup menus from checking to see if the event is a right
click to actually checking the isPopupTrigger() method.

changed the new message icon, the folder->Update title to folder->Get
New Messages, and put a new Get New Messages icon on the FolderDisplay.

some properties of the UserProfile, such as the selected sent folder and
the selected mail server, used to require a restart to change them.  they
now change without a restart.

changed the selection of things like the sent folder, trash folder, etc.,
to use only already subscribed folders.

made it so doing an open action on the folder node actually makes sure
that the Folder is in an OPEN state.

changed the display of newly received messages.  now if you try to display
messages before they're loaded, instead of loading the messages on the
AWT thread, you just show 'loading' for each frame.  when the table info
is loaded, the FolderDisplay gets updated with the new values.

made it so that the ReadMessageDisplay only populates one JEditorPane,
instead of 2 like it used to.

made it so that the main Pooka window shouldn't change size between 
starts as often.

changed the window place while in desktop pane mode.  new windows are now
not always places in the top left corner of the desktop.

020304 release
--------------

fixed a bug in the VariableBundle which made it so backslashes weren't
handled properly.  this caused file selection under windows to fail 
horribly.

added support for dynamically switching between LookAndFeels.

clicking Ok on a property editor now saves the current properties to disk.
this means that you no longer have to exit out of pooka cleanly in order to
have your changes save.

fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you right-clicked on an entry
in the AttachmentPane that wasn't selected.

fixed a bug where the ExternalLauncher wasn't executing correctly if there
was no wrapper specified.  this resulted in the inability to open attachments
on windows.

fixed a bug where the StoreNode and FolderNode were each updating their
gui components on the mail thread, rather than on the swint eventdispatcher
thread.

added a new default mailcap file, either '.pooka_mailcap' or 
'pooka_mailcap.txt'.  set it up so this file is the one written to by
default.  also reset the 'make command default' so that it actually works
properly.

added more spacing between the headers and the message on html messages.

added an icon for Pooka, and made it change icons when new messages come in.
	BUG:    the Pooka icon doesn't look great when it's made very small,
		and the new message icon is just perfunctory.  should get
		new ones.

improved the startup time for Multi Editor panes.

added support for custom colors and components for most (if not all) 
components.

added a Color selector and a Font selector.

made file->exit check for unsent messages and offer you a chance to send
them.  (BUG:  doesn't work properly under jdk1.2)

added saving messages as drafts (BUG:  doesn't work properly under jdk1.2)

Outbox no longer throws a NPE if the Outbox is not yet open.

added support for specifying SMTP port number (dan)

folder menu now uses submenus to display folders instead of one huge menu (dan)

added selectAll support for read messages, new messages, and the FolderTable.

added undo/redo support for the new message editor

added a File Selector for Configuration properties that take files.


011226 release
--------------

fixed a bug where two copies of a message could get added to the folder
list.

changed the system that synchronized with the IMAP subscribed folders so 
that it always considers INBOX subscribed.

the html as text, instead.

modified the New Account creation on startup to use the new Connection /
OutgoingMailServer system.

fixed the Search date formater to be MM/dd/yyyy instead of MM/hh/yyyy.

changed the SSL server support so that we now can connect using a self-signed
certificate chain.

fixed a bug in UIDFolderInfo which made it so you couldn't append 
non-UIDMimeMessages.

modified the fetch() functionality of the FolderInfos so that we only 
fetch Pooka.fetchBatchSize messages at a time.  this should reduce the amout
of time it takes to display large folders at startup.

changed the SMTP server support so that we now have a separate SMTP server
object, instead of having the servers configured in the UserProfile.

2001 november 05 release
------------------------

left on the server.

support added for pre and post connection commands for mailboxes (pilone)
