*) make cut and paste of messages give some sort of visual notification. 
   right now, if you select 20 messages, ^C, then go to another folder and
   ^V, it appears that nothing happens until suddenly the messages appear.

   global focus. -- sort of fixed.
*) ?? adding a new store removes the new message display filters on open stores?

*) add in opengl acceleration & antialiasing in 1.5/1.6 (??).
   -- opengl shouldn't be necessary as of jdk1.6_u10.  check antialiasing.
      also check why the internalframes are moving so slowly.
*) look at jdk6u10 updates--particularly nimbus l&f

---- (jdbc)
*) jdbc:
   *) put in options to prepopulate entries
      -- command line?
      -- .pookarc file?
         -- for .pookarc file, offer a way to work offline?
      -- consider web service jdbc driver???

   *) add in address book, trusted cert db, crypto keys.
      addr book:  fix wizard.  test it out.
   *) make sure we don't cache anything if we're trying not to.
   *) add in help????
---- (/jdbc)
*) editor:  fix newaddresswizard so that it resizes the dialog when you
   switch from file to jdbc.

*) check what happens if you hit enter on a subfolder while subscribing.
	-- see if we can make it so hitting enter opens the subfolder
	   rather than subscribing to it. -- setApproveButtonMnemonic()?

improve encryption support?
 -- improve address book?
 *) need easier way to access address book.
 *) address book sorting should be case-insensitive
*) change the keybinding for the address book.  otherwise you get address book
	entries while you're navigating the to field.

*) address book/ldap support.
	1)  make sure the matches go with the entry--i.e. if you match the
	    actual address, have the actual address appear first.
	2)  make it test for valid email addresses
	3)  make it add an extension to incomplete and unmatched addresses
	    (i.e. change 'allen' to 'allen@somehostname.org')
	4)  change the UI so that matched address aliases display differently
		(bold, in a different color, or some such).  that way a
		user can tell if the entered address is a proper alias or not.


*) encryption improvements.
   *) if no keystore named, don't try loading?  test.
	-- we still get errors there.  fix.
   *) make keystores get updated if you change them while running.  in other
	words, don't require a restart for encryption the first time.
	  -- done.  make update only happen once per change, though.
   *) add documentation
	*) need to document versions, including webstart cryptix info
	*) need to document unlimited strength jce info
   *) test autodecrypt/auto sig check.  requires keys synched to email address.
	test
   *) test auto sign/auto encrypt.
	test
   *) key management
	  - make sure you can use alternate keys even if one is set for
		the default user.
   *) fix keyboard focus on passphrase entry (make textfield have focus).
   *) encryption action should offer key list if no default key for address.
	-- figure out timing of that.
   *) make sure UI shows up for auto-encrypted messages.
   *) when selecting a key, have options for encryption (always use this key,
	etc.)
   *) fix threading on encryption actions.
     *) !!! we're parsing each message on load now. !!!

*) add console?

*) new attachment display w/icons?

*) redo attachment display

*) configure trash folder as default.

*) make sure non-ascii characters work in email text. -- and especially
	non-iso8859.

*) fix non-plaintext-password support with imap (logindisabled)


---------------------------

*) fix weird connection problem with 1.4.1.

*) getDefaultAddressBook should always return a value.
   -- have to go to ResourceManager?

------

*) ?? reorder folders ??

**) make wheel scroll customizable
*) trayicon stuff
  trayicon support:
    *) fix close to icon
    *) fix always display for a) minimized and b) switching to always display
	doesn't show icon until new message comes in.
    *) new custom click support:
	*) change click display so that we show a clickable dialog
		with the new messages, etc.
	*) change timeout support:  we should now handle timeout with
		mouseover
	*) should be able to tell if balloon is showing or not.
	*) autoupdate on balloon--if it's showing, either queue up 
		another one or update the current one (?)
	*) fix new message notification on folders if you read a message
		from the Open Message menu from the TrayIcon.
	*) focus problem.  fix.
*) add taskbar support on gnome, windows, and mac?
  add start / bring up pooka
	-- change 2xclick action (?)
	should go:
	  connected:  1xclick=show status?  2xclick = bring to front?
	  	      rightclick=show menu
	  disconnected:  1xclick=show status?  2xclick=start up?
		      rightclick=show menu?

---------

*) fix preview pane mode; make it look nice
	-- fix column widths; add in saving widths

*) add ssmtp support.

  *) email javamail-interest list re tls optional/required vs ssl

  *) email javamail-interest list re tls optional/required vs ssl only

   *)  key bindings for editors (!!)
	-- include the main editor -- you should be able to hit first letter
		and have it scan to first match.
	-- also on multieditorpanes, C-A should add, C-E should edit, etc.

*) test disconnected imap; make sure options (autoCache) work properly.

1)  clean up editors.
    -- clean up preferences. (see definition below)
    -- on folder, fix cacheMode?
    -- gui bug:  switch to preview mode.  apply.  it changes.  switch 
	back to desktop mode.  apply.  it doesn't change back.

2)  make sure brand new user configuration works

*) editors:
  *)  get new store wizard working.
	*) get wizard working from new user startup
	  *) fix on failure message.
		-- connect fails takes too long without showing feedback.
			looks like nothing is happening.
	  *) make welcome screen look/read better
	*) add in explanatory text/help
	*) ? test creating stores; make sure that we're getting the
	   correct editor al the time
	*) make sure that removing stores, users, etc. removes all
	   subsettings too.
	*) make strings automatically select the current value.

 ----- ui update
  *) Store editor:
	*) make settings work
		-- namespace support
		-- test autoCheckSeconds
	*) check disablefilters; make sure they all work
  *) UserProfile settings:
	-- append sig to each message option
	-- save to sent folder option
	*) check disablefilters; make sure they all work
  *) wizard
	*) fix new user / smtp server; make sure that new smtp server
		is only given if there is a new user.
		*) done.  make sure that naming of user / smtp server
		   only happens if you are creating a new one.
	*) make sure it works from new startup
	*) fix getCurrentProperty(); right now a default property isn't
		returned properly.
	*) imap to pop -- losing server name setting?

	minimize to icon on exit
     * settings
       * pooka mail directory
       * ssl cert file
       * spam action
       * logging

  *) address book
  *) outgoing servers
  *) encryption
 *) technical:
  *) TabbedEditorPane should make sure to expand to fit its area.
	-- it looks like it does.  maybe there's a problem with the
	   CompositeEditorPane?
  *) change selection/add buttons
   *) fix layout

  *) add in/make work text entries
*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.
*) write help screens along with images.

----- /ui update
 
*) open up local folder using open button:  icons fail to update.
	-- that's a bug with the mbox/maildir providers

*) fix ability to create new smtp server from first failure.

*) add an option to folders not to connect to them on store connect.

*) create a way to cache local headers so we don't have to download
   those all the time.  sort of like running offline, but not really.
	*) make this the default IMAP setting, barring running diskless
		-- done.  test.
	*) change UI -- make sure cache option, etc. doesn't show up.
		-- done.  test.
	*) fix loading headers for new messages -- looks like we do an
		individual fetch for each.
	   *) also add in some status messages during this; right now
	      opening a new large folder will take a while even if we're
	      just getting the headers and flags.

*) (??) add in option to open html-only messages as parsed html instead
	of 'real' html (??)

*) fix:  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't overwrite cause

-----

*) redo themes?
*) redo connections?

*) fix behavior when other mail client is connected; make sure we handle
deleted messages, etc. gracefully.

*) add a way to show update information when the webstart version is
	upgraded.

*) change build.xml to include everything in Imported, rather than doing
	each file explicitly.

online:
  *) look at online bugs, etc.

  *) change download link on site
    *) make sure mailing list info is correct
    *) update website in general
    *) add blog/rss feed

*) exit:  closing window should pop up a notice saying pooka is still
	running; file->exit should exit.

*) fix mbox to make it useful (now you can't create new folders).  make it
	so you can make maildir-based folder.

*) undelete?

*) make icons update dynamically.

*) bug?  change password of store with sent folder.  does sent folder
	get re-tagged as a sent folder?

*) check to make sure that show new message notification messages are
	updated dynamically, so if you change their values you don't
	have to restart to get the effect.

*) folder-check reopen attempts should only happen if the store is open
	or should be open.  they should not reopen the store.

*) webmail?????
	*) check out gmail and yahoo mail
	*) quick sample implementation?

*) fix manager exit cleanup of listeners; make it a consistent API.
*) listeners:
	*) make sure that on disconnection that we remove all listeners.
		*) check:  listeners on VariableBundle.
		*) check:  listeners on KeyboardManager (IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW).

*) fix 'failed to open folder' message in v. 2.0.

*) icon manipulation
 *) new splashscreen
 *) new TrayIcon, too?

*) add in notification for exiting to icon.
	actually exits.
	*) started.  need to make it reasonably nice.
		-- only do this in 2.0?

*) check out SwingWorker?

*) new splash screen.

*) change Item and ItemManager to using generics.

*) update locking code with new mechanism.
-----------

*) see if we can make pooka start up on correct virtual desktop

*) add a spell checker -- jazzy????

*) virtual folder support <sigh>

*) add plugin for spam checker?

*) fix tableinfos so that you after a disconnect/reconnect you don't
	have to re-fetch the headers, only the flags.

*) add an option to build.xml for compiling with deprecation enabled.

*) add support for running without any local files.
   *) big tasks:  
      *) url access for all file resources
      *) relative paths for files/urls
	-- support for http: access?
	    -- fix variable bundle to make sure that we close the stream
	    -- better error messages
	    -- come up with configuration/usage plan.
	    -- make it so we can start as '--http URL' 
	-- figure out problem spots:
		*) pop3 support?
			-- ruling out pop3 boxes.
		*) outgoing mailboxes?
			-- works fine.  would be better if we allowed sent
			   folder and outbox to be reassigned on translation.
		*) address books?
			-- gives error on startup. -- still does.  sigh.
		*) encryption key files
			-- gives error.
  *) file list:  pgp/smime files, signature file, address book, ssl cert file,
	mbox file (n/a).
   -- also:  pooka home, mailcap file, pookarc file

*) check out situation with multiple connections.  see if we can speed
   up things that way.  possibilities:
	*) reuse our connections so we don't have to renegotiate ssl
	   connections each time.
	*) use separate threads for each folder so we can do the ssl
	   negotiation in parallel.

*) open store.  close store.  first, all the folders open anyway.  second,
	the folders opening are opening with a null action.  third, after
	the closing, the previously-loaded messages all go to 'loading'.

-----

*) consider:  move stuff from the bottom status area to the toolbar area.  or
   at least figure out something to use all that space for.

*) add a real debug system.

*) add support for saved searches.

*) add ability for ui components to be enabled/disabled programmatically.
	- both for adding to menus/tables and enabling/disabling options.
*) add a dependent button/menu item.  so that that way instead of having
	a separate Caching popup menu, you can just say "if caching,
	add this menu item; if not, don't."

------

*) separate out ui interfaces from swing implementations.

*) check too many open files error on opening large cached folder?

*) fix NPE if try to send a new message without configuring client.

*) add mark as unread 

*) new message count in icon

*) start up disconnected.  connect.  have filters.  get error:
javax.mail.MessagingException: Error:  could not copy messages to folder:  net.suberic.pooka.cache.CachingFolderInfo@1e081c5

*) ?? change reply-all binding?

*) check:  if a folder realizes that it has become disconnected, it should
	test to see if the store in general has disconnected.
	-- see what happens when the network goes down and then we try to
	check folder/store connection again.

*) some case(s) in which we're not generating the attachment bundle 
	correctly?  one instance is how we're handling multipart/alternative
	entries that don't actually have multiple parts.
	see pooka_problems blob

*) add color support for replies (i.e. > in one color, >> in another, etc.)

*) MessageRemovedException from UIDMimeMessage.getMessage() should result in 
	message getting removed from display. (? does this ever happen?)

-----

*) fix error in encoded stream problem.
	-- just better error (?)  or maybe print out as far as it goes.
	-- see pooka_problems from plc

*) html with text attachment should show text attachment at the end. (??)

*) modify built-in java display code to show download dialog for showing
	attachments.

*) add "view pookarc"

*) theme bug in folder table display between preview and desktop.

------
*) printing
	*) better layout of printer frame.  center things?

*) more doc

*) add documentation and online help.
  -- general info, plus more detailed configuration information.
	topics:
	  running pooka
	  copyright/gpl
	  keybindings
	  configuring stores (imap,pop3,mbox)
	  reading mail
	  new mail
	  user profiles
	  outgoing mail config
	  network connections
	  disconnected operation
	  address book
	  searches
	  subscribing/unsubscribing folders
	  ui types
	  trash folder
	  sent folder
	  outgoing mail folder

*) add help for config stuff.


-------

*) make there a build option for help only, so i can switch it in 
	WebStart.

*) fix up the error messages, and make sure that they look ok.

*) document keybindings
	-- keybindings for address book
	-- keybindings for address entry panel
	-- keybindings for saving attachments.
	-- keybindings for opening folders.
	-- keybindings for detachwindow

*) make it so there's a way to close the store that actually resets
	the connection totally, so that if your network is screwed up 
	pooka can recover without restarting.

-----

*) additional crypto stuff
	- different KeyStores for different users?

*) regexp? (add search/replace to editor)
  -- started.  todo:
	*) add feature to NewMessage
	*) add replace feature
		-- check the caret location, too.

*) check for memory leaks
 -- especially w/preview pane mode?

*) preview pane: 
	--make it so the status bar is at the bottom, underneath
	the readmessagedisplaypanel--or possibly on the status pane.
	-- maybe change the toolbars so there's only 1?
	-- ?? make it so you can compose messages in the main window ??
  -- switching from preview to desktop gives outbox a "normal" toolbar.
  -- switching from desktop to preview, hitting return both opens window
	and shows the message in the preview pane.

*) ui:  stack trace button should really be with ok button, not by itself.

*) NPE -- is that from switching from preview to desktop?
	-- check window menu from switching preview to desktop.

*) disconnected from store (like if the server goes down) doesn't result in 
icons changing?  test.

*) disconnected:  
	*)  make an option for caching everything.
	*)  check sent folder with disconnected / especially not using
		the NetworkConnection object. -- note:  ok with the
		NetworkConnection.
	      -- making that work better.  now we add the message, but
	         it shows up as not cached.  also, change the algorithm
	         for numbering.
	*)  disconnected:  think that you're still connected.  lose connection.
	    get new messages.  doesn't work properly.
	*)  reading a message in disconnected mode doesn't actually mark
	     it read. -- ?? test.  seems to work.
	*)  add:  autocache up to a certain size.

*) umm, implement tile and cascade.  :)

*) make it so you can add to the address book from the selection
		panel.

*) threading of attachment actions.

----------------------

*) add a keybinding to bring up the address book selector.

*) spam filtering

*) make sure that if you close a store, it doesn't reopen it.
	-- ?? should work.  look for testcase.

*) come up with a wrapper for spawning external editors on windows.

*) make it so folders that can contain folders but have no subfolders have
	the correct icon.

*) get some decent pooka icons.
	
*) search for sent folders ends up doing loading on the display thread.

*) make search window look different than normal window.

*) add 'filter by message'

*) remove 'where' clause from filter.

*) add support for hierarchical new message notification--so getting an email
	in foo/bar would show up on foo as well as bar.

*) add icons for connecting to folder/store

*) make it so we only get one connection failed message for a store.

*) sent folders, outboxes, etc. should be configured without requiring a
	restart.  also, should be able to change store protcol/connection
	info without restarting.

*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.FolderInfo.getTrashFolder(Unknown Source)
	at net.suberic.pooka.MultiMessageInfo.deleteMessage(Unknown Source)
	(from search folder)

*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.gui.MessageProxy.refreshMessage(MessageProxy.java:353)
	at net.suberic.pooka.thread.LoadMessageThread.loadWaitingMessages(LoadMessageThread.java:185)
	at net.suberic.pooka.thread.LoadMessageThread.run(LoadMessageThread.java:53)

*) make it so you can stop html displays from showing non-local images.
 	-- support RFC-2557??
*) bug:  html text is always black, no matter the theme or the 
specifications in the html itself.

	-- disconnected imap --

*) check to see what happens when we lose our connection before all of
	the messages are loaded (esp. before the tableinfos are loaded)

*) each loading of the FolderTableInfo rechecks the unread message
	count, which sucks for performance.  improvements with new
	caching system???

*) each loading we also recache the flags no matter what.  this is probably
not very efficient.

*) reply to an email from you should go to the recipient.

---

*) mail import?

*) follow-ups?

*) write html mail?

*) 'advanced searching'

*) search folders

*) 'do not download this mail' rule

*) labels?

*) message threading

*) make an option where message windows size to the viewport of the
desktop pane.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*)  when you change users for a new message, then, even if the theme 
doesn't change, you still resize the window.

*) add support for external editors, such as emacs.

error:  filterfoldercellrenderer has problems with search forms.

*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.
	-- a little bit of a bug, but not too much.  should probably
	check the actual message source to see how tabs are sent.

*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  
	-- *)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- *)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- *)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

*) add threading of messages (?) 

*) set priority (?)

*) loadMessageTracker?  it doesn't seem to show up anymore.

*)  make it so file->exit gives you the option for expunging deleted messages
    from your mailboxes.

*) a nested message which is of type text/html doesn't get shown on the
	display.

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) multi-deleted throw a NPE

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) add 'edit message as new' for normal messages.

*) add support for flowed text

*) customize settings on folder window--headers, window size.

*) add customization editor for toolbars and menus. 

*) check it to see if we can still get the same kind of 
	folders-always-available performance while not keeping a separate
	imapd connection open for each folder.
