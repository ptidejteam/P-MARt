29-Apr-2004 : [API] In CategoryPlot, datasets, renderers and axes are now 
                    stored in lists, doing away with the explicit distinction
                    between "primary" and "secondary" items.  This has

27-Apr-2004 : [API] In XYPlot, datasets, renderers and axes are now stored in 
                    lists, doing away with the explicit distinction between
                    "primary" and "secondary" items.  This has involved a
                    significant change to the API (a simplification overall).
                    
              [NEW] Added relative pie chart contributed by Benoit Xhenseval
                    (see RFE 942195).

              [NEW] Logging code was improved to be closer to Log4J

23-Apr-2004 : [NEW] Added fillBox attribute to BoxAndWhiskerRenderer and
                    XYBoxAndRenderer - also extended equals() method and fixed
                    serialization issues for both.

21-Apr-2004 : [NEW] Barak Naveh has contributed word-wrapping of legend items. 
                    To use it, see the StandardLegend.setPreferredWidth() 
                    method. The org.jfree.chart.demo.LegendManiaDemo shows how 
                    it works.
                    
              [NEW] Added CategoryStepRenderer class (plus

                    legend.

              [BUG] LogarithmicAxis changed to use numberFormatOverride if it
                    is set - see patch 930139.
                    
              [BUG] Changed the TextUtilities.createTextBlock() method to use
