<H1>JSR47 vs. log4j (take two)</H1>

<p>In the next, still unpublished draft of JSR 47, the
<code>java.util.logging</code> API will resemble log4j even more.  The
way the APIs name componets may vary but otherwise their degree of
resemblance is quite scary.

<p>Changes introduced in the latest draft include configuration order
independence, appender inheritance, resource bundle inheritance, error
handlers and lazy inference of caller information. In other words, the
vast majority of the points raised in my <a
href="critique.html">previous critique</a> of JSR47 are now
obsolete. That is clearly good news.

<p>It is fair to say that our campaign to influence the JSR47 API has
handsomely bore fruit. I wish to thank all those who have expressed
their support for the campaign. My gratitude goes to Jason Hunter for
arranging the appropriate commucation channel to Sun. Graham Hamilton,
the JSR47 specification lead, was very open and receptive during our
exchanges.

<p>As one of its authors, I still think that at its core log4j is a
better API in some small ways. I will not delve into the differences
because they are somewhat secondary.

<p>There are two critical differences however. First, JSR47 requires
JDK 1.4 whereas log4j is compatible with JDK 1.1 and later. Second,
log4j has much more functionality. It supports a rich configuration
language and about a million appenders and layouts.

<p>Efforts to backport JSR47 to earlier JDKs are doomed to fail
because the <code>java.util.logging</code> package is located under
the <code>java</code> namespace. This will cause backported code to
systematically throw a <code>SecurityException</code> under JDK
1.3. Moreover, Java is a trademark owned by Sun Microsystems. As such,
the backported code will be under the threat of litigation as long as
Sun is expected to defend its trademark.

<p>Even without the <code>SecurityException</code> and the trademark
issue, the backported code would need to be installed. If you are
going to install a logging API, then why not install log4j which
offers a lot more than JSR47?

<p>Log4j is the de facto logging API in Java. It has been ported to
Python, C++ and the much maligned C#. By using log4j one
simultaneously benefits from much richer functionality and wider JDK
compatibility.
