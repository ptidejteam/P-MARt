<p>
  The Sun <i>Dot-Com Builder</i> developer information site just did a "Best Practices" product profile on Velocity.  Check it out 
  <a href=" http://dcb.sun.com/practices/profiles/velocity.jsp">here.</a>  Thanks Sun!

 <section name="What is Velocity?">

 <p>
    Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits web page designers
    to use simple yet powerful template language to reference objects
    defined in Java code. Web designers can work in parallel with Java
    programmers to develop web sites according to the Model-View-Controller
    (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can focus solely on creating
    a site that looks good, and programmers can focus solely on writing
    top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code from the web pages,
    making the web site more maintainable over the long run and providing
    a viable alternative to
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">Java Server Pages</a>
    (JSPs) or <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
    Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for
    example, it can generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see <a
    href="./anakia.html">Anakia</a> for more information on XML transformations)
    from templates.  It can be used either as a standalone utility for
    generating source code and reports, or as an integrated component of other
    systems.  Velocity also provides template services for the
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> web application
    framework. Velocity+Turbine  provides a template service that will allow
    web applications to be developed according to a true MVC model.

<section name="Where do I get releases?">

</p>

<p>

<section name="Where do I get nightly snapshots?">

<p>
    Nightly snapshots of the Velocity CVS can be found
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-velocity/nightly/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  These are meant to provide easy access to the actual project CVS tree. 
As this is our live development workspace, there are 
no guarantees as to what you will find there,although we do our best to maintain 
a buildable source tree. 
If you are looking for the stable supported release, please use the current 
release of Velocity.
</p>

<p>
If you are willing to risk getting dirty, we invite you to try the nightly snapshot 
to see the current state of affairs (and help out!) 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html">Public CVS access</a> is also available.
