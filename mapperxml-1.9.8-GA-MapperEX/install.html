		<h1>Notes for Running MapperXML Examples</h1>
		<p>These notes are designed for testing with any web application (war) 
			server. The examples include an Ant build script. To run these 
			examples you need the following components installed and 
			configured:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Java VM 1.4+</li>
			<li>Web Application Server (Tomcat 4+, JBoss, etc)</li>
			<li>Ant (optional - needed to run build.xml script)</li>
		</ul>
    
    <h2>Running Pre-Built Example</h2>
    <p>The following are the quick directions to deploy and run the pre-built examples:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Copy the file mapperex.war to your application server's
          deployment directory (or use it's deployment tool). For
          JBoss or Tomcat the location is:
    <pre>
               [jboss-install-dir]/server/default/deploy
               -- or --
               [tomcat-install-dir]/webapps
    </pre>
          </li>
      <li>Start Tomcat or JBoss</li>
      <li>Browse to http://localhost:8080/mapperex</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Building and Running Example</h2>
    <p>The following are the quick directions to build and run the examples:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Create a ".build.properties" file in the root of the project</li>
      <li>Add a property setting in the file: 
    <pre>
    deploy.dir=[jboss-install-dir]/server/default/deploy
               -- or --
               [tomcat-install-dir]/webapps
    </pre>
          where the deploy.dir is the path to your application server's
          deployment directory.
          </li>
      <li>Run the Ant target "deploy" in build.xml</li>
      <li>Start Tomcat or JBoss</li>
      <li>Browse to http://localhost:8080/mapperlibrary</li>
    </ul>
