<P>
This package is a system to allow the invocation and control of
a new Java virtual machine. The two JVMs can communicate by using
RMI.
</P>
<P>
To simply invoke a new JVM with no communications links, use
the class {@link ExecJVM}. The rest of this page explains how
to use this framework to create a new JVM and set up bidirectional
communications using RMI. This system runs a second JVM using the same
classpath as the current JVM (by invoking {@link
ExecJVM#runJVMPropogateClassPath}).
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Create a remote interface that the master JVM will support,
    extending {@link MasterRemote}. This interface must specify of the
    methods that the slave JVM can call on the master JVM.
    All methods in this interface must be declared to throw
    {@link java.rmi.RemoteException.}</LI>
<LI>Create a remote interface that the slave JVM will support,
    extending {@link SlaveRemote}. This interface must specify of the
    methods that the master JVM can call on the slave JVM.
    All methods in this interface must be declared to throw
    {@link java.rmi.RemoteException.}</LI>
<LI>Create the master JVM implementation, which must extend
    {@link AbstractMasterJVM} and implement
    YourMasterInterface. Note that the <CODE>super()</CODE> call
    must pass to AbstractMasterJVM the fully-qualified class name
    of the slave JVM implementation.</LI>
<LI>Create the slave JVM implementation, which must implement
    YourSlaveInterface.
    Don't forget to implement {@link SlaveRemote#quit},
    which is called when the main JVM requests the slave to quit,
    and {@link SlaveRemote#start}, which is called when the slave JVM
    is started.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Now you can create an instance of your master JVM class and use
its {@link AbstractMasterJVM#invokeSlave} method to start
the slave JVM.
