  <title>Building Velocity from Source</title>
  <author email="jvanzyl@zenplex.com">Velocity Documentation Team</author>
 </properties>

<body>

<section name="Installation">

<p>
Velocity runs on a variety of platforms that have installed the Java 2
Virtual Machine. The J2SDK is required for users who want to compile
Velocity from its source code.
</p>

<p>
Everything required to build Velocity comes with the distribution, which
can be obtained from <a
href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">Subversion</a> or
from the <a
href="http://svn.apache.org/snapshots/jakarta-velocity/">nightly
snapshots</a>.  However, you will need to install Ant, an excellent
Java-based build tool.  Ant is also a Jakarta project, and can be
found <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The directory tree of the distribution looks like :
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
jakarta-velocity
  /build        - contains build scripts
  /bin          - where the built jars / classes will go
  /src          - source for Velocity, Anakia, and Texen
  /docs         - documentation in HTML form
  /docs/api     - Javadocs for Velocity source
  /examples     - example/demonstration code
  /convert      - tools to help convert WebMacro templates
  /test         - test programs and templates
  /xdocs        - source for our documentation
]]></source>

</section>

<section name="Required Tools">

<p>
To make building Velocity easy and consistant, we require a Jakarta project
called <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant</a> version 1.6 or
higher to perform the build process. We assume that you have followed
Ant's installation instructions and have it properly installed.  It's not
difficult, and I think that you will find it an excellent addition to
your programmer's toolbox.  
</p>

<p>Note that there is an experimental <a href="maven.apache.org">Maven</a> 
build included with the distribution, but Ant remains the recommended method.
</p>

<p>
Velocity requires JDK 1.4 or greater to compile.  It's possible to use JDK 1.3 
to compile but several useful features will not be included.  Velocity requires 
a minimum of JDK 1.3 to run.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you wish to modify Velocity's grammar you will need to a tool
called <a href="http://javacc.dev.java.net">JavaCC</a>.  We recommend 
version 3.2 or greater (for compatibility with JDK 1.5 syntax changes).
</p>

</section>

<section name="Jar Dependencies">

<p>Velocity requires various third party jar files for compiling and for running.  Not all 
jar files are required in all cases.  When building, all dependencies will be downloaded
automatically unless the <code>skip.jar.loading</code> property is set.  
</p>

<table>

<tr>
  <th>Jar</th>
  <th>Purpose</th>
  <th>Required at Runtime?</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><code>antlr-2.7.5.jar</code></td>
  <td>XML parsing (XPath queries in particular)</td>

  <td><code>junit-3.8.1.jar</code></td>
  <td>For running unit tests</td>
  <td>No</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>
Note that you can always create a jar with all required run-time dependencies by running the 
task <code>jar-dep</code>.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Building">

<p>
In each case below, it is assumed that you were successful in getting
the distribution from Subversion or as a nightly build, and with the latter,
were successful in unpacking.  Also, it is assumed that you are starting
in the 'jakarta-velocity' directory, the root of the distribution tree.
All directory references will be relative to 'jakarta-velocity'.
</p>

<p>
Change to the <b>build</b> directory (<code>cd
build</code>). Then, to build the jar file, simply type:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
ant
]]></source>

<p>
Executing this script will create a <b>bin</b> directory
within the Velocity distribution directory. The <b>bin</b>
directory will contain the compiled class files (inside a
<b>classes</b> directory) as well as a
<b>velocity-XX.jar</b> file, where XX is the current
version number. Be sure to update your classpath to include Velocity's
<b>.jar</b> file.
</p>

<p>
Note that to build any of the specific build targets simply add
the target name to the command line.  For example, to build the Javadoc
API documentation :
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
ant javadocs
]]></source>


<p>Some of the most useful targets are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b><code>jar</code></b> builds the complete Velocity jar in the
    <code>bin</code> directory.  This jar will be called 'velocity-X.jar',
    where 'X' is the current version number. This jar does not include
    necessary dependencies for Velocity.  If you use this
    target, you must put the required dependent jars in your CLASSPATH (or WEB-INF/lib).
    For convenience, you can use the <code>jar-dep</code> target to build
    a jar with all required dependent classes included.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>jar-dep</code></b> builds the complete Velocity jar in
    the <code>bin</code> directory.
   </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>clean</code></b> deletes all generated classes, jars, documentation, and other files.
   </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>docs</code></b> builds these docs in the <code>docs</code> directory
    using Velocity's <a href="anakia.html">Anakia</a> XML transformation tool.
    Allows you to use
    Velocity templates in place of stylesheets
    - give it a try!
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>examples</code></b> builds the example code in the example programs
    found in the <code>examples</code> directory. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>jar-src</code></b> bundles all the Velocity source code into a single
    jar, placed in the <code>bin</code> directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>javadocs</code></b> builds the Javadoc class documentation in the
    <code>docs/api</code> directory
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>package</code></b> will generate the complete Velocity distribution package.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>parser</code></b> will compile the JavaCC parser files from src/Parser.jjt into
    the appropriate Java source files.  Requires JavaCC 3.2+ to be installed, and the
    property <code>javacc.home</code> to contain a path to the installed JavaCC directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><code>test</code></b> (after jar) will test Velocity against its testbed
    suite of test routines.
  </li>
</ul>



<p>
Velocity should build 'out of the box', independent of your classpath.
If you get an error building Velocity, try a different nightly build (as
sometimes we make a mistake and the Subversion at the time of the nightly
snapshot isn't complete) or refresh from Subversion (you might have gotten a
Subversion snapshot while a developer was checking things in.)
</p>

<p>
If the problems persist, do not hesitate to ask the Velocity community
via our mail lists. They can be found <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">here</a>. 
</p>

</section>

<section name="Testing Your Installation">

<p>
The Velocity developers use an automated test facility, and it is
included in the distribution. You can use it to make sure that all is
well with your build of Velocity.
</p>

<p>
To run the test suite, simply use the build target
<b>test</b> when you build :
</p>
<source><![CDATA[
ant test
]]></source>

<p>
If all is well, you should see output similar to :
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
junittest:
    [junit] Running org.apache.velocity.util.TestSimplePool
    [junit] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.025 sec

<p>
Note that the number of tests may vary from those shown above, but if
you see 'OK' after the tests are run, all is well.
