ECMA v3 is missing section 15.9.1.7 and has two sections named 15.9.1.9.  Therefore,
I renamed the first duplicate to the name of the missing section:

	15.9.1.7  Daylight Saving Time Adjustment (was 15.9.1.9)

This doesn't affect affect any test cases.

ECMA v3 is missing section 15.9.5.32 and has two sections named 15.9.5.36.  I renamed
the first duplicate to the name of the missing section:

	15.9.5.32  setUTCHours (was 15.9.5.36)

This required renaming the following test cases:

	15.9.5.33.js -> 15.9.5.32.js
