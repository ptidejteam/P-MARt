    <title>Installing and Running MapperXML Library Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Notes for Running MapperXML Library Example</h1>
    
    <p>NOTE: This example works, but is not yet complete. Additional features will be added in subsequent releases.</p>
    <p>These notes are designed for testing with Tomcat or JBoss.  The examples
    also include an Ant build script.  To run these examples you need the
    following components installed and configured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Java VM 1.4+</li>
      <li>Web Application Server (Tomcat 4+, JBoss, etc)</li>
      <li>Eclipse or Ant (needed to run build.xml script)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Running Pre-Built Example</h2>
    <p>The following are the quick directions to deploy and run the pre-built examples:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Copy the file mapperlibrary.war to your application server's
          deployment directory (or use it's deployment tool). For
          JBoss or Tomcat the location is:
    <pre>
               [jboss-install-dir]/server/default/deploy
               -- or --
               [tomcat-install-dir]/webapps
    </pre>
          </li>
      <li>Start Tomcat or JBoss</li>
      <li>Browse to http://localhost:8080/mapperlibrary</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Building and Running Example</h2>
    <p>The following are the quick directions to build and run the examples:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Create a ".build.properties" file in the root of the project</li>
      <li>Add a property setting in the file: 
    <pre>
    deploy.dir=[jboss-install-dir]/server/default/deploy
               -- or --
               [tomcat-install-dir]/webapps
    </pre>
          where the deploy.dir is the path to your application server's
          deployment directory.
          </li>
      <li>Run the Ant target "deploy" in build.xml</li>
      <li>Start Tomcat or JBoss</li>
      <li>Browse to http://localhost:8080/mapperlibrary</li>
    </ul>
